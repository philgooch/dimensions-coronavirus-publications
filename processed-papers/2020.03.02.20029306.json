        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: A new virus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was later named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV are still not clear.\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China.\nMethod: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia.\nResults: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly.\nConclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe pneumonia. Clinicians should focus on these characteristics to identify high-risk patients at an early stage.",

The level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, creactive protein, serum procalcitonin, D-dimer, and B-type natriuretic peptide were higher in the patients with severe pneumonia. The white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hemoglobin, and alanine aminotransferase did not differ between the two groups.

The variables with statistical differences between the two groups were incorporated into in the logistics regression equation. To better understand the correlation between the lymphocytes and D-dimer measurements with severe pneumonia, we divided the values of the lymphocytes and d-dimer by their standard deviations. The results revealed that after adjusting for other confounding factors, the age and",
            "D-dimer values were independent risk factors of severe pneumonia (Table 2). Patients over the age of years and in the range of 40 to 60 old had a significantly higher risk of developing severe pneumonia than those under the age of 40. For every 1 standard deviation increase in the D-dimer value, the patients' risk of developing severe pneumonia increased by about 17 times. In addition, lymphocytes were found to be independent protective factors for severe pneumonia. The incidence of severe pneumonia in patients with a 0.55 increase in lymphocytes decreased by about 67.8%.",

Severe pneumonia usually progresses rapidly, and many clinical indicators can change in a short time, especially the lymphocyte, D-dimer, serum albumin, and chest CT manifestations. To better identify severe pneumonia early, we calculated the difference in the lymphocyte counts, serum albumin values, and D-dimer values at different points in time (Table 3, Figs. 1-4). The results showed that in the early stage of the disease, the lymphocyte and serum albumin decreased and the D-dimer increased with the progress of the disease. We have included 2 chest CT scans of one patient with severe pneumonia at different time periods, which suggested the rapid progress of the disease (Fig. 5)."

These results suggested that the level of D-dimer was significantly positively correlated with the 2019-nCoV severe pneumonia, which was also shown in another study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV could bind to ACE2, down-regulating the expressions of ACE2, and resulting in an increased Angiotensin II level in mouse blood samples, signaling through Angiotensin II receptor 1, and induced acute lung injury[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. ACE2 is a receptor protein of both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, and it is abundantly present in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>].

These changes eventually lead to an increase in D-dimer. A significant lymphocyte decline in the progression of severe pneumonia was also observed, which was consistent with the results of Huang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Decreased lymphocytes suggested that 2019-nCoV may primarily attack the body's immune system, especially the T lymphocytes, which is similar to the action of SARS-CoV[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. After 2019-nCoV impairs the immune system, it is difficult to prevent the virus replication by immediately forming the neutralizing antibody. Non-specific pulmonary secondary inflammation acts with the 2019-nCoV infection, inducing cytokine storms and producing a series of immune responses and causing disorders of the lymphocyte subsets. Therefore, the above may explain the decline of lymphocytes and the rise of D-dimer in the progression of severe pneumonia. In addition, the pulmonary CT findings of patients with severe pneumonia can progress rapidly, so it is important to review chest CT scans in a timely fashion to learn about the pulmonary lesions."

Current studies have shown that 2019-nCoV has about an 89% 36 homology with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% homology with human SARS-CoV[9]. The 37 disease is highly contagious, and may rapidly develop into severe pneumonia, acute respiratory 38 distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and death, so the top 39 priority for clinicians is to identify and treat the severest patients in the early stage. The aim of this 40 study was to assess the potential high-risk factors of 2019-nCoV severe pneumonia and provide 41 evidence for the screening of severely afflicted patients.",

Every patient had completed the relevant laboratory 48 examination, including various common pathogen detection and chest computed tomographic (CT) 49 scans. All of the patients were local residents of Wuhan.

The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection of 52 some patients was positive, while for others, it was negative.
