        "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global threat to public health. Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. \nMethods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR.\nFindings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%\uff0c68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs.\nInterpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs.<br/><br/>Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

        "discussion": [
            "SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Timely and accurate diagnosis of the virus enables appropriate treatment of infections. RT-PCR is widely deployed in diagnostic virology. In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated assays become available. In our study, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was greater than that other reports (78% vs 30%-50%) in the first assay. The reasons for the high sensitivity of our series may include[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]: The first was samples, in some hospital, the patients\u2019 nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were collected for testing the SARS-CoV-2 separately. In our study, the detection specimen was the patient's pharyngeal and nasal swabs combine, compared to the pharyngeal or nasal swab only , indicating higher sensitivity at initial screening. We show that the strategy for the detection of viral RNA in pharyngeal and nasal swabs used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is not perfect. We also found that the virus are present in several stool swabs of patients when pharyngeal and nasal swabs detection negative. Based on the infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory and fecal-oral routes, we applied test for oral and stool swabs which could greatly improved detection positive rate. Among the 87 laboratory-confirmed cases, there were still 19 cases with RT-PCR results testing negative in the first assay. In the false negatives can be caused by poor sample quality, such as respiratory tract samples collected from the oropharynx; collection that is too early or late in the progression of the disease, in the early stages, the number of viruses in the body is not enough to be detected. samples that have not been properly stored, transported, or processed, SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is RNA virus, which is prone to death and degradation. In the process of collecting samples and transporting them to the laboratory for testing, it takes a long time and the nucleic acid is easy to degrade, so it is not easy to detect positive. At last, technical factors, including virus mutation and PCR inhibition."

According to the traditional Koch\u2019s postulates, virus isolation is the gold standard for virus diagnosis in the laboratory. Thus, based on SARS-CoV-2 possesses a strong capability to infect humans, CDC recommends that clinical virology laboratories should not attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from COVID-19 patients under investigation. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus, the spectrum of the available diagnostic tools is tight.

At present, RT-PCR is a widely used detection technique for SARS-CoV-2 and several marketed nucleic acid detection kits for using in clinic[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].

However, the scholar around china indicated that cases of COVID-19 that had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT-PCR results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens before finally laboratory-confirmed[13].

Therefor it is difficult to differentiate COVID-19 suffers from other pneumonia patients purely depending to the manifestation or routine examination. Therefore , an precision screening scheme is urgent to be employed. High sensitive test is pivotal to avoiding secondary transmission by missed diagnosed cases. Meanwhile, the positive predictive value also should be counted, for a number of false positive would bring out not only occupation and cost of healthcare resource, but also increasing infection risk of suspected cases isolated in hospital.

            "In the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, RT-PCR for pharyngeal and CT scan is the main screening strategy. Aiming to evaluate the property of the two methods in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection, the performance indexes of RTPCR detection and CT scan were computed respectively. The results were shown in Table[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR for pharyngeal were 78.2% and 98.8%. positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 91.9% and 96.2. and Youden\u2019s index was 0.770, which indicated overall performance. In the methodology evaluation of CT scan, criteria was defined firstly as an image diagnostic method. According the standard above, the data about the CT scan performance were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 68.2%, lower than RT-PCR of pharyngeal. positive predictive and negative predictive value were 56.8% and 92.3% and Youden\u2019s index was 0.343 (Table[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]).",
            "Besides that, we also analyze the agreement of the two methods (The cases with uncertain CT results were not involved in statistical analysis due to statistical limitations). As is shown in Table[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], there was statistically significance between the two methods (p<0.001). Moreover, there was statistically differences in the diagnosis of non-COVID-19 patients(p<0.001), but not in COVID-19 patients (p=0.734). The agreement was good to fair agreement (kappa value, 0.430) , and the adjusted agreement was 72.8% in all patients.",
            "Given that the time on receiving detection can cause influences on sensitivity, the time differences between RT-PCR for pharyngeal and CT scan were compared. The average time of nucleic acid screening was earlier than that of CT scan statistically (-0.7390days, -3625~1.674) (Table 4). The COVID-19 group received an of CT scan later than the non-COVID-19 group in average (-1.7160,-5.185~1.753 v.s . -0.4594, -2.391~1.472, p=0.002) (Table 4).",
            "In purpose to explore the characteristics of the RT-PCR and CT scan in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 127 cases with inconsistent diagnosis by two methods were selected for further analysis, which is consisted of 34 COVID-19 patients and 93 non-COVID-19 cases (Fig.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]). Notably mild cases count to 94.1% in COVID-19 suffers (32/34) (Fig[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].A). 20 of the 32 cases showed RT-PCR positive & CT negative or RT-PCR positive & CT uncertain, suggested the priority of RT-PCR in identifying mild infections. There are still 12 cases with RT-PCR negative & CT positive or RT-PCR negative & CT uncertain, we are inclined to consider unqualified sampling or low viral load in early stage were responsible for the false discovery of RT-PCR. Only two inconsistent cases were severe infections (Fig[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].A)., indicating both of the methods reached the good accordance. Besides that, we also focused the results pattern in 93 non-COVID 19, that mainly presented RT-PCR negative & CT positive (n=40) and RT-PCR negative & CT uncertain (n=49) (Fig[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].B). That is 95.3% (89/93) patients possessed negative RT-PCR but abnormal CT results. We concluded that CT scan is an morphology detection, not pathogen identification, hence, it was difficult to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses or pathogens accurately.",
            "It is notable that both of the methods acquired the sensitivity less than 80% in screening SARS-CoV-22 infections, which is not ideal enough for the diagnosis of infectious diseases with severe consequences. To develop more appropriate detection scheme, the performances of combination",
            "RT-PCR and CT were evaluated in future. The 568 cases being subjected to first RT-PCR and second RT-PCR for pharyngeal and 341 being subjected to CT scan were analyzed. The performance indexes were shown in Table[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The results showed that the sensitivity of RT-PCR in parallel with CT scan was the highest( 91.9%), which was higher than that of parallel with second nucleic acid (86.2%) (Table[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]). But the specificity of two nucleic acid detections was significantly higher than that of combination of nucleic acid and CT, suggesting that nucleic acid in parallel with CT was more appropriate to screen SARS-CoV-22 infections, and two nucleic acid tests for exclusion diagnosis maybe more suitable. 3.3 The value of nucleotide detection in stool was evaluated in COVID-19 patients.",
            "It is reported that alive virus can survive in stool of COVID-19 patients. According our data, 8.6% patients (Table1) cannot be identified by combination of RT-PCR for pharyngeal swab and CT scan. Since that, can the RT-PCR test for stool be an efficiency assisting examination? In this study, there were 75 COVID-19 cases subjecting to stool nucleotide detection. Therefore, all of the RT-PCR results from 75 case with stool nucleotide detection were plotted along time axis (Figure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]). It was demonstrated that 35 cases had at least one positive results and the discovery rate is 46.7%. The stool presented earlier positive than the throat swab in two cases (patient No 21, 38) (Figure3) . Moreover, pharyngeal swab of No.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] patient had been always negative until the end of the study. There were 16 patients with remaining positive results of stool after two consecutive negative results of pharyngeal swabs ( patient No.2,8,13,15,18,21,24,26,27,29,30,35,39,40,42,48) during their hospitalization (Figure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]). Importantly, of the 14 discharged patients, two cases had stools being negative later than pharyngeal swabs (Patient No.2,10) (Figure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]). The data above suggested that the detection of fecal nucleic acid could be employed to improve the discovery rate and might be developed as an indicator of monitoring and de-isolation."

        "Discussion": [
            "SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Timely and accurate diagnosis of the virus enables appropriate treatment of infections. RT-PCR is widely deployed in diagnostic virology. In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated assays become available. In our study, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was greater than that other reports (78% vs 30%-50%) in the first assay. The reasons for the high sensitivity of our series may include[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]: The first was samples, in some hospital, the patients\u2019 nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were collected for testing the SARS-CoV-2 separately. In our study, the detection specimen was the patient's pharyngeal and nasal swabs combine, compared to the pharyngeal or nasal swab only , indicating higher sensitivity at initial screening. We show that the strategy for the detection of viral RNA in pharyngeal and nasal swabs used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is not perfect. We also found that the virus are present in several stool swabs of patients when pharyngeal and nasal swabs detection negative. Based on the infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory and fecal-oral routes, we applied test for oral and stool swabs which could greatly improved detection positive rate. Among the 87 laboratory-confirmed cases, there were still 19 cases with RT-PCR results testing negative in the first assay. In the false negatives can be caused by poor sample quality, such as respiratory tract samples collected from the oropharynx; collection that is too early or late in the progression of the disease, in the early stages, the number of viruses in the body is not enough to be detected. samples that have not been properly stored, transported, or processed, SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is RNA virus, which is prone to death and degradation. In the process of collecting samples and transporting them to the laboratory for testing, it takes a long time and the nucleic acid is easy to degrade, so it is not easy to detect positive. At last, technical factors, including virus mutation and PCR inhibition.",
            "In our study, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was higher than that of the chest CT (78.5% vs 66.7%, respectively). The reasons for the relatively lower efficiency of chest CT is may include, 1) The major of COVID-19 patients was mild, in the early detection, there is no features or typical features of chest CT in our study. 2) We divided three groups in the 365 patients, one group is COVID-19 positive, the other group is COVID-19 negative. Our results support RT-PCR combine chest CT for first screening for COVID-19 for patients with clinical and epidemiologic features.",
            "To date, two team from China have reported to succeed isolating alive SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients feces (data unpublished). According to these study, some of the provisions have been supplemented about strictly handling the patient's secretions. Many coronaviruses can be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to lineage B, \u03b2 betacoronavirus ( -CoV) genus. The other member in this lineage is SARS-CoV, responsible for \u03b2 SARS outbreak in 2003 in China, can be detected in the stool of patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. MERS, lineage C -CoVs, has been proved existing in the feces[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. For it is not too surprise to detect SARS-CoV-2 in stool. It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the stool of a patient in the USA16,17. However, our study give an important hint that in a big portion of COVID-19 patients\u2019 stool are there the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and up to 16 patients presented positive stool after two negative pharyngeal swabs, which indicates stool nucleotide has potential role in monitoring infection as an supplement item.",
            "Moreover, what deserve attention more is patients No.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], who had none positive pharyngeal swabs in all the stage of infection, but positive stool. Until the end of the observation, the patient were still under treatment. Although it can\u2019t be absolutely excluded that pharyngeal presented false negative or shifting positive later, at least stool detection need be involved in examination for the strongly suspected persons with negative pharyngeal swab. Besides that, that stool remain positives in a later stage of infection suggests that fecal nucleic acid negative conversion should be included in the discharge criteria. In our center, there was no recurrence infection in 17 discharged patients, for the stool nucleotide had been detected before being out of hospitalization. Of course, we just provide the evidence the RNA in the stool. whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by oral to fecal need to be studied in future.",
            "Combination of pharyngeal RT-PCR and chest CT with higher sensitivity is an reasonable option to screen SARS-CoV-2 infection patients. Two pharyngeal RT-PCR detections with higher specificity can be used in exclude diagnosis. RT-PCR has the more advantage in screening mild infection comparing to chest CT. RT-PCR of stool should be adopted to improve discovery rate and counted as an item for discharging from hospital. Our study shed light for the optional scheme of the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "3.1 The common characteristics of the patients and specimen in this study The patients involved in this study summed 568, including 87 COVID-19 and 481 non-COVID19.",
            "The authors looked through the case data retrospectively and found that 5 patients without CT scan were admitted to hospital complaining of epidemiology contact.",
            "They were eventually diagnosed, they had only mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection on admission and in the course of infection, and no CT scan had been performed"

            "SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>].",
            "The authors found that the virus are present in several stool swabs of patients when pharyngeal and nasal swabs detection negative.",
            "Based on the infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory and fecal-oral routes, the authors applied test for oral and stool swabs which could greatly improved detection positive rate.",
            "In the process of collecting samples and transporting them to the laboratory for testing, it takes a long time and the nucleic acid is easy to degrade, so it is not easy to detect positive.",
            "Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, the authors comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19"
