We aimed to build a mathematical model to capture the global trend of epidemics outside China.\n\nMethods: In this retrospective, outside-China diagnosis number reported from Jan 21 to Feb 28, 2020 was downloaded from WHO website. We develop a simple regression model on these numbers:\nlog[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] (Nt+34)=0.0515*t+2.075\nwhere Nt is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, t=1 at Feb 1.\n\nFindings: Based on this model, we estimate that there have been about 34 unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China. The global trend is approximately exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days.",

The global trend is approximately exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days.<br/><br/>Research in context Evidence before this study In December 2019, pneumonia infected with a novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. Now the situation is almost controlled in China but is worse outside China. Now there are 4,691 patients across 51 countries and territories outside China. We searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published up to Feb 28, 2020, using the keywords \u201cCOVID\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d or \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d. No published work about the global trend of epidemics outside China could be identified. Added value of this study We built a simple \u201clog-plus\u201d linear model to capture the global trend of epidemics outside China. We estimate that there have been about 34 unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China. The global trend is approximately exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days. Implications of all the available evidence With the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a straightforward model is expected to work better. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 disease follows an approximate exponential growth model stably at the very beginning. We predict that the number of confirmed patients outside China will increase ten folds in every 19 days without strong intervention by applying our model. Powerful actions on public health should be taken to combat this epidemic all over the world."

            "In this report, we only analyzed the total number of diagnoses outside China. The country scale data is available but is not as complete as total number. Here, we limited this analysis to capture the global trend.<br/><br/>This model is a minimal extension of the \u2018default\u2019 exponential growth model with the estimation of 34 unobserved founder patients outside China. An almost perfect model fitting (R2=0\u00b7991) indicates that the spread of disease does follow our model.<br/><br/>A simple and straightforward linear model inherits with some advantages: (1) it works on small sample size due to limited observation or somewhat unperfect data. (2) it is relatively robust in complex situations. The virus spreading pattern is complex and yet varies across the world. A simple model simplified the situation and provides coarse-grained trend estimation. (3) A linear model has nice extrapolation ability comparing to complex models (e.g. Neural network)."

Since the first case of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 was reported from Wuhan, COVID-19 patients had rapidly been diagnosed in other cities of China and the neighboring countries including Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and even to a few Western countries.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] On January13 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand reported the first imported case of lab-confirmed novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 13 As of Feb28 2020, cases had been reported in 52 countries and territories. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached 4,691 outside China, 9 and the number is still increasing. South Korea, the worst affected country outside China, has reported another jump. The 571 new cases brought South Korea\u2019s total confirmed cases to 2,337. A surge in cases of COVID-19 in Italy, Japan and Iran also heightened fears that the world is on the brink of a pandemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] In Feb 28, WHO increased the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level.",
            "Recently, many researchers devoted to more details about the analysis of the spread of epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Some paralleled results have shown that the reproductive number R0 estimated of COVID-19 is bigger than that of SARS based on different models. 16-18 With the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a straightforward model is expected to work better (see Discussion). In this study, we propose a \u201clog-plus\u201d model for the situation prediction which only requires daily number of total diagnosis outside China. This model assumes that there were some unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China and exponential growth later. Despite the simplicity of our model, it fits the data well (R2=0.991). The prediction is expected to provide practical significance on social application and evidence for enhancing public health interventions to avoid severe outbreaks."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Data Table The WHO daily count of diagnosis number outside China and its \u201clog-plus\u201d transform as well as model fit were shown in table 1.",
            "Parameter Estimation  7  ,  7  and  8  were estimated as 34, 0\u00b70515 and 2\u00b7075 respectively according to Feb 28 data (figure 1)",
            "Global Trend Model We plot  !\"( # + 34) against time to visualize the model fitting (figure 2). The model R2 is 0\u00b7991 indicating an excellent model fit.",
            "Future Number Prediction Currently the number of diagnoses at Febuary 28 is 4,691. We predict that the number of diagnoses outside China will expand exponentially with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days without strong intervention."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Based on this model, we estimated that there have been about 34 unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China. Our model suggests that the COVID19 disease follows an approximate exponential growth model stably at the very beginning. The situation is dangerous as we expect 10 folds increases of patients every 19 days without strong intervention. We call on world-wide strong actions on public health referring to experiences learnt from China and Singapore."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "In this report, we only analyzed the total number of diagnoses outside China. The country scale data is available but is not as complete as total number. Here, we limited this analysis to capture the global trend.",
            "This model is a minimal extension of the \u2018default\u2019 exponential growth model with the estimation of 34 unobserved founder patients outside China. An almost perfect model fitting (R2=0\u00b7991) indicates that the spread of disease does follow our model.",
            "A simple and straightforward linear model inherits with some advantages: (1) it works on small sample size due to limited observation or somewhat unperfect data. (2) it is relatively robust in complex situations. The virus spreading pattern is complex and yet varies across the world. A simple model simplified the situation and provides coarse-grained trend estimation. (3) A linear model has nice extrapolation ability comparing to complex models (e.g. Neural network).",
            "The existent of 34 unobserved founder patients is not surprising. They may have mild symptoms thus did not went to the hospitals. However, we did not preclude the possibility that they already existed before or parallel with Wuhan\u2019s burst.",
