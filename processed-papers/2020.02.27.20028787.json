Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. \nMETHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA).\nRESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). \nCONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.",

            "At present, the sample collection for nucleic acid detection of suspected cases of COVID-19 is mostly upper respiratory tract samples (mainly throat swabs) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The collection of throat swabs is not standardized and it is easy to miss the diagnosis. The collection process is extremely risky for medical staff. Confirmed diagnosis is playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. A fast-performing serologic assay is acutely needed for the current and outbreak."

            "GICA The novel coronavirus IgG/IgM antibody GICA kits (lot number 2001010220) were manufactured by Zhu Hai Liv Zon Diagnostics Inc, China. The 126 serum samples \u03bc were tested according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For each test, 10 L of serum \u03bc sample and 100 L of sample diluent were added vertically onto the sample pad of the test strip. The strip was then placed flat to allow the solution to migrate up the membrane, through gold-labeled pad, the testing area, quality control area and finally to adsorption zone. After 10 min, the result was judged by the color of the test and control lines. If both the detection band and the control band turned red, the sample was recorded as positive. If the control band turned red but the detection band was not colored, it was recorded as negative. If neither band was colored, the test reagents were assumed to be not working.",
            "Throat swab samples, sputum samples and alveolar lavage fluid samples were collected for extracting 2019-nCoV RNA from patients suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection. After collection, the throat swabs were placed into a sterile test tube with 1 ml sterile saline, the sputum samples were added equal volume of acetylcysteine (10g/L) and shaken at room temperature for 30 min to be fully liquefied, and total RNA was extracted using the nucleic acid extraction kit (QIAamp \u03bc viral RNA mini kit). In brief, 40 L of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm/min for 5 minutes. The \u03bc suspension was used for qRT-PCR assay of 2019-nCoV RNA. Then, n*19 L mixed \u03bc reagent of fluorescence PCR detection for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and n* 1 L",
            "RT-PCR enzyme (n was the number of reaction tubes) were mixed and vortexed for a \u03bc few seconds. The above mixture of 20 L was put into the PCR reaction tube \u03bc respectively, after that the extracted sample by 5 L was added. qRT-PCR analysis was conducted using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System. The PCR parameters were 45 \u00b0C for 10 min, 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 58 \u00b0C for 30 s, and a single fluorescence detection point at 58\u00b0C. Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were simultaneously amplified and tested during the qRT-PCR assay. The qRT-PCR assay was performed using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co Ltd). A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.",

        "Discussion": [
            "At present, the sample collection for nucleic acid detection of suspected cases of COVID-19 is mostly upper respiratory tract samples (mainly throat swabs) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The collection of throat swabs is not standardized and it is easy to miss the diagnosis. The collection process is extremely risky for medical staff. Confirmed diagnosis is playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. A fast-performing serologic assay is acutely needed for the current and outbreak.",
            "In this study, we tested serum samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients with two assay kits and achieved a high positive rate. The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and IgG detection was 55/63 (87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and IgG detection was 75/91 (82.4%), and the healthy controls were negative. The case group was COVID-19 patients diagnosed by qRT-PCR. Since many patients are undergoing treatment, they are gradually recovering, the nucleic acid test result has become negative, so the positive rate of patients tested was only 51.9%.",
            "It is worth noting that the new type of coronavirus antibody of the kit is against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus, not only against SARS-CoV-2, but the IgG originally infected with SARS may also be positive. But our research found, the healthy controls are all negative and the specificity is very good.",
            "ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they can offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients. They use plasma or serum as test samples, and blood samples can be collected easily, which can greatly reduce the risk of infection for medical staff. The complicated processing procedure of the sample during the laboratory test is removed, the test result can be obtained quickly, the operation is simple, the safety of medical staff can be protected, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.",
            "Although ELISA and GICA are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference. Cases confirmation still depended on qRT-PCR, and analyze epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and other laboratory data. There is a need to further increase the number of samples tested to prove their t of sample testing to confirm their significance.",
            "In conclusion, ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe for diagnosis COVID-19. The results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved."
