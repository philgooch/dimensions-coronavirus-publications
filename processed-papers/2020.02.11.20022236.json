        "abstract": "We present a timely evaluation of the impact of lockdown on the 2019-nCov epidemic in Hubei province, China. The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal. Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese regions remains a matter of further investigation.",

            "The lockdown has effectively shut down most forms of transportation, both public and private, the authors estimate the number of person-to-person contacts per day among its residents has reduced from thirteen to ten.",
            "The authors forecast that the number of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases will reach its peak of 12,143 (5,872-19,852) individuals at 27 (23-36) days (i.e., 17 Feb [14-27 Feb]) after the lockdown initiation (Figure 1c).",
            "The trend will gradually decline and the cumulative number of infections and death cases in Hubei province will reach 128,960 (39,362-218,560) and 4,381 (1,667-7,095) at the end of the epidemic (Figure 1a), corresponding to a fatality rate of 3.44% (3.19-3.70%).",
            "If the lockdown has been delayed for seven days, the authors may observe a larger number of confirmed cases at peak (18,095 [8,618-28,274]), the total infections (169,030 [53,238284,820]) and deaths (5,905 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,254-9,556]).",
            "If the delay has been 14 days, the epidemic will peak at 25,194 (11,634-39,667) confirmed cases and the total infections and deaths will reach 210,400 (66,785-354,020) and 7,451 (2,784-12,118), respectively."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "In the case where no lockdown was in place, the epidemic will peak at 36,544 (13,919-61,243) confirmed cases and the total infections and death cases will reach 348,750 (84,140-613,360) and 11,076 (3,408-18,744), respectively.",
            "The authors present a timely evaluation of the impact of \u2018lockdown\u2019 on the 2019-nCov epidemic in Hubei province, China.",
            "Authors' contributions M.S., Z.P., Y.G., Y.X., and L.Z. conceived and designed the study."
