        "abstract": "Wuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus.",

            "The current study was designed to construct possible vaccines against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019, which is the cause of the recent outbreak of the deadly viral pneumonia in China. To carry out the vaccine construction, four candidate proteins of the virus were identified and selected from the NCBI database. Only highly antigenic sequences were selected for further analysis since the highly antigenic proteins can induce better immunogenic response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c153\" href=\"#r153\">153</a>]. Because the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein were found to be antigenic, they were taken into consideration for vaccine construction.<br/><br/>The physicochemical property analysis was conducted for the two antigenic proteins. The extinction coefficient can be defined as the amount of light that is absorbed by a particular compound at a certain wavelength [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c154\" href=\"#r154\">154</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c155\" href=\"#r155\">155</a>]. Surface glycoprotein had the highest extinction coefficient of 148960 M-1 cm-1. The aliphatic index of a protein corresponds to the relative volume occupied by the aliphatic amino acids in the side chains of the protein, for example: alanine, valine etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c156\" href=\"#r156\">156</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c157\" href=\"#r157\">157</a>]. Surface glycoprotein had the highest aliphatic index among the two proteins (84.67). For this reason, surface glycoprotein had greater amount of aliphatic amino acids in its side chain than the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The grand average of hydropathicity value (GRAVY) for a protein is calculated as the sum of hydropathy values of all the amino acids of the protein, divided by the number of residues in its sequence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c158\" href=\"#r158\">158</a>]. Surface glycoprotein also had the highest GRAVY value of -0.079 among the two proteins. However, both of them had the predicted in vivo half-life of 30 hours and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein had the highest theoretical pI of 10.07. Both the proteins showed quite good results in the physicochemical property analysis."

        "conclusion": [
            "The Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019 has caused one of the deadliest outbreaks in the recent times. Prevention of the newly emerging Wuhan Novel Coronavirus infection is very challenging as well as mandatory. The potentiality of in silico methods can be exploited to find desired solutions with fewer trials and errors and thus saving both time and costs of the scientists. In this study, potential subunit vaccines were designed against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019 using various methods of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design the vaccines, the highly antigenic viral proteins as well as epitopes were used. Various computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. For this reason, if satisfactory results are achieved in various in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggested vaccine constructs might be used effectively for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infection and spreading. Therefore, our present study should help the scientists to develop potential vaccines and thapeutics against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019.

        "2.15. Protein-Protein Docking": [
            "In protein-protein docking, the constructed Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019 vaccines were analyzed by docking against some MHC alleles as well as the toll like receptor (TLR) and then one best vaccine was selected based on the docking scores. During viral infections, the MHC complex recognize the viral particles as potent antigens. The various portions of the MHC molecules are encoded by different MHC alleles. For this reason, the constructed vaccines should have very good binding affinity with these segments of the MHC complex that are encoded by different alleles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c128\" href=\"#r128\">128</a>]. In this experiment, all the vaccines constructs were docked against DRB1*0101 (PDB ID: 2FSE), DRB3*0202 (PDB ID: 1A6A), DRB5*0101 (PDB ID: 1H15), DRB3*0101 (PDB ID: 2Q6W), DRB1*0401 (PDB ID: 2SEB), and DRB1*0301 (PDB ID: 3C5J) alleles. Moreover, it has been proved that TLR-8 is responsible for mediating the immune responses against the RNA viruses and TLR-3 is responsible for mediating immune responses against the DNA viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c129\" href=\"#r129\">129</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c130\" href=\"#r130\">130</a>]. The coronavirus is an RNA virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c131\" href=\"#r131\">131</a>]. For this reason, the vaccine constructs of Wuhan novel coronavirus were docked against TLR-8 (PDB ID: 3W3M). The protein-protein docking study was conducted using different online docking tools to improve the prediction accuracy of the docking study. At first, the docking was performed by ClusPro 2.0 (https://cluspro.bu.edu/login.php). The server ranks the docked complexes based on their center scores and lowest energy scores. However, these scores do not correspond to the actual binding affinity of the proteins with their targets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c132\" href=\"#r132\">132</a>]-[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c134\" href=\"#r134\">134</a>]. The binding affinity (\u0394G in kcal mol-1) of the docked complexes were later generated and analyzed by PRODIGY tool of HADDOCK webserver (https://haddock.science.uu.nl/). The lower binding energy represents the higher binding affinity and vice versa [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c135\" href=\"#r135\">135</a>]-[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c137\" href=\"#r137\">137</a>]. After that, the docking was again carried out by PatchDock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) server and later refined and rescored by FireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). The FireDock server ranks the docked complexes based on their global energy and the lower global energy represents the better result. Finally, the docking was conducted using HawkDock server (http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/hawkdock/). At this stage, the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) study was also calculated by the HawkDock server which works on specific algorithm that depicts that, the lower score and lower energy represent the better scores [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c138\" href=\"#r138\">138</a>]-[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c141\" href=\"#r141\">141</a>]. For each of the vaccines and their respective targets, the score of model 1 was taken for analysis as well as the model 1 of every complex was taken into consideration for MM-GBSA study. From the docking experiment, one best vaccine was selected. The docked structures were visualized by PyMol tool [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c142\" href=\"#r142\">142</a>]. 2.16. Molecular Dynamic Simulation The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study was carried out for only the best selected vaccine. The online MD simulation tool, iMODS (http://imods.chaconlab.org/) was used for molecular dynamics simulation study. iMODS server is a fast, online, user-friendly and effective molecular dynamics simulation server. The deformability, B-factor (mobility profiles), eigenvalues, variance, co-variance map and elastic network of the protein complex, are predicted quite efficiently by the server. For a protein complex, the deformability depends on the ability to deform at each of its amino acid. The eigenvalue represents the motion stiffness of the protein complex and the energy that is required to deform the structure. The lower eigenvalue represents easy deformability of the complex. The server is a fast and easy tool for determining and measuring the protein flexibility [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c143\" href=\"#r143\">143</a>]-[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c147\" href=\"#r147\">147</a>]. For analysing the molecular dynamics simulation, the CV-1-TLR-8 docked complex was used. 2.17. Codon Adaptation and In Silico Cloning The best predicted vaccine from the previous steps, was reverse transcribed to a possible DNA sequence which is supposed to express the vaccine protein. The reverse transcribed DNA sequence was adapted according to the target organism, so that the cellular machinery of that organism could use the codons of the newly adapted DNA sequence efficiently for producing the desired vaccine. Codon adaptation is a necessary step of in silico cloning since an amino acid can be encoded by different codons in different organisms (codon biasness) and codon adaptation predicts the best codon for a specific amino acid that should work properly in a particular organism. The predicted protein sequence of the best selected vaccines were used for codon adaptation by the Java Codon Adaptation Tool or JCat server (http://www.jcat.de/). Eukaryotic E. coli strain K12 was selected at the JCat server and rho-independent transcription terminators, prokaryotic ribosome binding sites and SgrA1 and SphI cleavage sites of restriction enzymes, were avoided. The protein sequence was reverse translated to the optimized possible DNA sequence by the JCat server. The optimized DNA sequence was then taken and SgrA1 and SphI restriction sites were attached to the N-terminal and C-terminal sites, respectively. Finally, the SnapGene restriction cloning module was used to insert the newly adapted DNA sequence between the SgrA1 and SphI restriction sites of pET-19b vector [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c148\" href=\"#r148\">148</a>]-[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c150\" href=\"#r150\">150</a>]."

To carry out the vaccine construction, four candidate proteins of the virus were identified and selected from the NCBI database. Only highly antigenic sequences were selected for further analysis since the highly antigenic proteins can induce better immunogenic response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c153\" href=\"#r153\">153</a>]. Because the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein were found to be antigenic, they were taken into consideration for vaccine construction.",

The extinction coefficient can be defined as the amount of light that is absorbed by a particular compound at a certain wavelength [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c154\" href=\"#r154\">154</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c155\" href=\"#r155\">155</a>]. Surface glycoprotein had the highest extinction coefficient of 148960 M-1 cm-1. The aliphatic index of a protein corresponds to the relative volume occupied by the aliphatic amino acids in the side chains of the protein, for example: alanine, valine etc. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c156\" href=\"#r156\">156</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c157\" href=\"#r157\">157</a>]. Surface glycoprotein had the highest aliphatic index among the two proteins (84.67). For this reason, surface glycoprotein had greater amount of aliphatic amino acids in its side chain than the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The grand average of hydropathicity value (GRAVY) for a protein is calculated as the sum of hydropathy values of all the amino acids of the protein, divided by the number of residues in its sequence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c158\" href=\"#r158\">158</a>]. Surface glycoprotein also had the highest GRAVY value of -0.079 among the two proteins.

T-cell and B-cell are the two main types of cells that function in immunity.

The helper T-cell contains CD4+ molecule on its surface, for this reason, it is also known as CD4+ T-cell. On the other hand, other type of T-cell, cytotoxic T-cell contains CD8+ molecule on their surface, for which, they are called CD8+ T-cell. MHC class-I molecules present antigens to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. After activation by the antigen, the T-helper cell activates the B-cell, which starts to produce large amount of antibodies. Macrophage and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell are also activated by the T-helper cell that cause the final destruction of the target antigen [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c159\" href=\"#r159\">159</a>]-[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c163\" href=\"#r163\">163</a>].

The cluster analysis of the MHC alleles which may interact with the selected epitopes during the immune response, showed quite good interaction with each other. Next the 3D structures of the selected epitopes were generated for peptide-protein docking study. The docking was carried out to find out whether all the epitopes had the capability to bind with their respective MHC class-I and MHC class-II alleles. Since all the epitopes generated quite good docking scores, it can be concluded that, all of them had the capability to bind with their respective targets and induce potential immune response. However, among the selected epitopes, QLESKMSGK, LIRQGTDYKHWP, GVLTESNKK and TSNFRVQPTESI generated the best docking scores. After the successful docking study, the vaccine construction was performed. The linkers were used to connect the T-cell and B-cell epitopes among themselves and also with the adjuvant sequences as well as the PADRE sequence. The vaccines, with three different adjuvants, were constructed and designated as: CV-1, CV-2 and CV-3. Since all the three vaccines were found to be antigenic, they should be able to induce good immune response. Moreover, all of them were possibly nonallergenic, they should not be able to cause any allergenic reaction within the body as per in silico prediction. With the highest aliphatic index of 54.97, CV-3 had the highest number of aliphatic amino acids in its side chain. The highest theoretical pI of CV-1 indicated that it requires high pH to reach the isoelectric point. Quite similar results of extinction co-efficient were generated by the three vaccine constructs. The three vaccine construct showed quite good and similar results in the physicochemical property analysis.",
            "The secondary structure of the vaccine constructs revealed that CV-1 had the shortest alpha-helix formation, with 25% of the amino acids in the alpha-helix formation, however, 67.1% of the amino acids in coil formation. For this reason, most of the amino acid acids of CV-1 vaccine was in coil structure, which was also the highest percentage of amino acids in coil structure among the three vaccines. On the other hand, CV-3 had the highest amount of amino acids in the alpha-helix formation (37.8%), among all of the vaccines. However, all the three vaccine constructs had most of their amino acids in their coil structures. In the tertiary structure prediction, all the three vaccine construction showed quite satisfactory results. In the tertiary structure refinement and validation, CV-1 vaccine construct generated the best result with 94.3% of the amino acids in the most favored region and 4.4% of the amino acids in the additional allowed regions. CV-2 also showed good result 90.0% of the amino acids in the most favoured region. In the disulfide bond engineering experiment, only CV-1 was found to follow the selection criteria for disulfide bond formation. With the lowest and best results generated by the MM-GBSA study, HawkDock study and ClusPro 2.0 server, CV-1 was considered as the best vaccine construct among the three vaccines. For this reason, CV-1 was selected for molecular dynamics simulation study, codon adaptation and in silico coding study. The molecular dynamics simulation study revealed that the TLR-8-CV-1 docked complex should be quite stable with a good eigenvalue. The complex had less chance of deformation and for this reason, the complex should be quite stable in the biological environment. The Figure 09f shows that a good number of amino acids were in the correlated motion that were marked by red color. Finally, codon adaptation and in silico cloning experiments were performed and with 1.0 CAI value, it could be concluded that the DNA sequence should have very high amount of favorable codons that should be able to express the desired amino acids in the target microorganism, E. coli strain K12. The DNA sequence also had quite high and good amount of GC content of 51.34%. Finally, the pET-19b vector, containing the CV-1 vaccine insert was constructed which should efficiently and effectively encode the vaccine protein in the E. coli cells."

        "5. Conclusion": [
            "The Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019 has caused one of the deadliest outbreaks in the recent times. Prevention of the newly emerging Wuhan Novel Coronavirus infection is very challenging as well as mandatory. The potentiality of in silico methods can be exploited to find desired solutions with fewer trials and errors and thus saving both time and costs of the scientists. In this study, potential subunit vaccines were designed against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019 using various methods of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design the vaccines, the highly antigenic viral proteins as well as epitopes were used. Various computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. For this reason, if satisfactory results are achieved in various in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggested vaccine constructs might be used effectively for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infection and spreading. Therefore, our present study should help the scientists to develop potential vaccines and thapeutics against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019.
