        "abstract": "Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.\nMethods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on  January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried.\nFindings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. \nInterpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.\nFunding National  Key  R&amp;D  Program  of  China, Ningbo Health Branding Subject Fund,   Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen, K.C.

It is of utmost urgency to carry out public health interventions to reach out to individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek conventional medical care. Considering the extremely contagious nature of the 2019-nCoV, a slight incompliance by even a small portion of the population may have grave consequences and contribute to the continued exponential increase of the outbreak cases."

Keywords: 2019-nCoV; institutional trust; preventive behaviors Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on January 28, 2020, for articles that describe the trust, preventive practices and health-seeking behaviors related to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China, using the search terms \u201cnovel coronavirus,\u201d \u201cinstitutional trust,\u201d \u201cbehavioral change,\u201d \u201cprotective behaviors,\u201d and \u201ctreatment-seeking\u201d with no language or publication time restrictions. Previously published research discussed the behavioral responses to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Hong Kong. The only report investigating the influence of institutional trust and public responses was published on March 27, 2019, on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. No previous studies have investigated how trust in the information provision and prevention instructions from the authorities during a disease outbreak has influenced the public\u2019s prevention practices and treatment-seeking in the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV.",

This study found a considerably high level of institutional trust among the public in the epicenters.",

This finding is in contrast to the study on the Ebola outbreak in Congo, where their public expressed higher trust in their local authorities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. There is a need to enhance trust in the local authority, as they are the frontline in service delivery during the outbreak. Lack of trust in the local authority results in poor cooperation, thus undermining contact tracing and adherence to recommended public health interventions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Healthcare providers can be strong advocates for outbreak prevention efforts in these communities, considering that many expressed a high level of trust in them.",

            "Wearing a face mask in public places and at home when around other household members is advisable based on CDC recommendations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In consideration that human-to-human transmission among close family members has been reported in overseas countries such as Germany, Japan, and Vietnam, the community in Hubei province and the epicenters should be made aware of the essential importance of wearing face masks when they are around other household members.",
            "The main strength of this study is the finding of the strong influence of institutional trust on overall preventive behaviors, in good agreement with previous studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",
            "As the 2019-nCoV epidemic is still growing exponentially, continued strengthening of institutional trust, and in particular, increasing the trust in the local authority, is essential for emergency management. outbreak control.",
            "The study also found that uptake of prevention practices was poorer among older members of the public, which warrants serious attention. It has been found that older adults affected by 2019-nCoV are likely to have a higher risk of complications and mortality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. There is a need to find out whether a lack of appropriate prevention practices among people of older age is due to knowledge deficiency or to their being out-of-reach of current public health intervention.",
            "The finding that nearly 15% of people would be reluctant to seek treatment in the hospital if they were suspected to have been infected with 2019-nCoV is clinically important and worrisome. Of utmost importance, a proportion of those participants are in the city of Wuhan and currently under quarantine. The preference for using traditional healing among a minority of the older respondents is also of concern. Refusal to seek hospital treatment not only leads to progress to serious respiratory distress and can be life-threatening, but also increases the chances of spreading the disease. People who favor traditional healing should be made aware that seeking conventional treatment in the hospital and obeying the quarantine order are the most appropriate actions in containing this outbreak. Finally, the finding of the strong influence of institutional trust on seeking conventional treatment again amplifies the immense importance of building trust between the public and the government authorities.",

Second, the responses were based on self-report and may be subject to selfreporting bias and a tendency to report socially desirable responses. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. Third, the snowballing method used in this study can lead to selection bias. Nevertheless, the demographic distributions of our study population resembles of the general population in Hubei province. Despite these limitations, the study data contributes tremendously to understanding of public responses, especially now that the epidemic is growing exponentially.",
            "In conclusion, bridging the trust gaps between the public and local authorities in the epicentres is crucial. It is of utmost urgency to carry out public health interventions to reach out to individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek conventional medical care. Considering the extremely contagious nature of the 2019-nCoV, a slight incompliance by even a small portion of the population may have grave consequences and contribute to the continued exponential increase of the outbreak cases."
