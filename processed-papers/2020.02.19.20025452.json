        "abstract": "As a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to emerge throughout China and threaten the globe, its transmission characteristics remain uncertain. Here, we analyze the serial intervals-the time period between the onset of symptoms in an index (infector) case and the onset of symptoms in a secondary (infectee) case-of 468 infector-infectee pairs with confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by health departments in 18 Chinese provinces between January 21, 2020, and February 8, 2020. The reported serial intervals range from -11 days to 20 days, with a mean of 3.96 days (95% confidence interval: 3.53-4.39), a standard deviation of 4.75 days (95% confidence interval: 4.46-5.07), and 12.1% of reports indicating pre-symptomatic transmission.",

            "Appendix<br/><br/>Data We collected publicly available data on 6,903 confirmed cases from 271 cities of mainland China, that were available online as of February 8, 2020. The data were extracted in Chinese from the websites of provincial public health departments and translated to English (Table S3). We then filtered the data for clearly indicated transmission events consisting of: (i) a known infectorand infectee,(ii) reported locations of infection for both cases, and (iii) reported dates and locations of symptom onset for both cases. We thereby obtained 468 infector-infectee pairs identified via contact tracing in 93 Chinese cities between January 21, 2020 and February 8, 2020 (Figure S1). The index cases (infectors) for each pair are reported as either importations from the city of Wuhan (N= 239), importations from cities other than Wuhan (N= 106) or local infections (N= 122).

            "A new coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020\u200b [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. As of February 19, 2020, the WHO has reported over 75,204 COVID-19 infections and over 2,009 COVID-19 deaths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], while key aspects of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 remain unclear [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].The serial interval of COVID-19 is defined as the time duration between a primary case (infector) developing symptoms and secondary case (infectee) developing symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].Obtaining robust estimates for the distribution of COVID-19 serial intervals is a critical input for determining the reproduction number which can indicate the extent of interventions required to control an epidemic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].However, this quantity cannot be inferred from daily case count data alone [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "To obtain reliable estimates of the serial interval, we obtained data on 468 COVID-19 transmission events reported in mainland China outside of Hubei Province between January 21, 2020, and February 8, 2020. Each report consists of a probable date of symptom onset for both the infector and infectee as well as the probable locations of infection for both cases.",
            "The data include only confirmed cases that were compiled from online reports from 18 provincial centers for disease control and prevention (Table S3).",
            "Notably, 59 of the 468 reports indicate that the infectee developed symptoms earlier than the infector. Thus, pre-symptomatic transmission may be occurring, i.e., infected persons may be infectious before their symptoms appear. In light of these negative-valued serial intervals, we find that COVID-19 serial intervals better resemble a normal distribution than more commonly assumed gamma or Weibull distributions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]that are limited to strictly positive values (see Supplement). We estimate a mean serial interval for COVID-19 of 3.96 [95% CI 3.53-4.39] with a standard deviation of 4.75 [95% CI 4.46-5.07], which is considerably lower than reported mean serial intervals of 8.4 days for SARS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]and 12.6 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]- 14.6 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]for MERS. The mean serial interval is slightly but not significantly longer when the index case is imported (4.06 days [95% CI 3.55-4.57]) versus locally infected (3.66 days [95% CI 2.84-4.47]); it is slightly shorter when the secondary transmission occurs within a household (4.03 days [95% CI 3.12-4.94]) versus outside of the household (4.56 days [95% CI: 3.85-5.27]). Combining these findings with published estimates for the early exponential growth rate COVID-19 in Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], we estimate a basic reproduction number (R\u200b0)of 1.32 [95% CI 1.16-1.48] [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], which is lower than published estimates that assume a mean serial interval exceeding seven days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "These estimates reflect reported symptom onset dates for 752 cases from 93 Chinese cities, who range in age from 1 to 90 years (mean 45.2 years and SD 17.21 years). Recent analysis of COVID-19 case data from mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, South Korea, Germany and Singapore have reported average serial intervals of 7.5 days [95% CI 5.3-19] [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], 4.4 days [95% CI 2.9-6.7] [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]and 4.0 days [95% CrI 3.1-4.9] [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]based on considerably smaller samples of 6, 21 and 28 infector-infected pairs, respectively. Whereas none of these studies report negative serial intervals in which the infectee developed symptoms prior to the infector, 12.6% of the serial intervals in our sample are negative.",
            "We note four potential sources of bias in our estimates, three of which are likely to cause underestimation of COVID-19 serial intervals. First, the data are restricted to online reports of confirmed cases and therefore may be biased towards more severe cases in areas with a high-functioning healthcare and public health infrastructure. The rapid isolation such cases may have prevented longer serial intervals, potentially shifting our estimate downwards compared to serial intervals that might be observed in an uncontrolled epidemic. Second, the distribution of serial intervals varies throughout an epidemic, with the time between successive cases contracting around the epidemic peak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].To provide intuition, a susceptible person is likely to become infected more quickly if they are surrounded by two infected people rather than just one. Since our estimates are based primarily on transmission events reported during the early stages of outbreaks, we do not explicitly account for such compression and interpret the estimates as basicserial intervals at the outset of an epidemic. However, if some of the reported infections occurred amidst growing clusters of cases, then our estimates may reflect effective (compressed) serial intervals that would be expected during a period of epidemic growth. Third, the identity of each infector and the timing of symptom onset were presumably based on individual recollection of past events. If recall accuracy is impeded by time or trauma, cases may be more likely to attribute infection to recent encounters (short serial intervals) over past encounters (longer serial intervals). In contrast, the reported serial intervals may be biased upwards by travel-related delays in transmission from primary cases that were infected in Wuhan or another city before returning home. If their infectious period started while still traveling, then we may be unlikely to observe early transmission events with shorter serial intervals. Indeed, the mean serial interval is slightly higher for the 218 of 301 unique infectors reported to be imported cases. Given the heterogeneity in type and reliability of these sources, we caution that our findings should be interpreted as working hypotheses regarding the infectiousness of COVID-19 requiring further validation as more data become available. The potential implications for COVID-19 control are mixed. While our lower estimates for R0\u200b suggest easier containment, the large number of reported asymptomatic transmission events is concerning.",

Bars indicate the number of infection events with specified serial interval and blue lines indicate fitted normal distributions for (a) all infection events (N= 468) reported across 93 cities of mainland China by February 8, 2020 and (b) the subset infection events (N= 122) in which both the infector and infectee were infected in the reporting city (i.e., the index case was not an importation from another city). Negative serial intervals (left of the vertical dotted lines) suggest the possibility of COVID-2019 transmission from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases."

The data were extracted in Chinese from the websites of provincial public health departments and translated to English (Table S3). We then filtered the data for clearly indicated transmission events consisting of: (i) a known infectorand infectee,(ii) reported locations of infection for both cases, and (iii) reported dates and locations of symptom onset for both cases. We thereby obtained 468 infector-infectee pairs identified via contact tracing in 93 Chinese cities between January 21, 2020 and February 8, 2020 (Figure S1).

            "We used maximum likelihood fitting and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to evaluate four candidate models for the COVID-19 serial interval distributions: normal, lognormal, Weibull and gamma. Since our serial interval data includes a substantial number of non-positive values , we fit the four distributions both to truncated data in which all non-positive values are removed and to shifted data in which 12 days are added to each observation (Figure S1 and Tables S2-S3). The lognormal distribution provides the best fit for the truncated data (followed closely by the gamma and Weibull). However, we do not believe there is cause for excluding the non-positive data and would caution against making assessments and projections based on the truncated data. The normal distribution provides the best fit for the full dataset (shifted or not) and thus is the distribution we recommend for future epidemiological assessments and planning."
