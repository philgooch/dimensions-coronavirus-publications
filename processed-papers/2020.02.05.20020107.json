        "abstract": "In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;[60] vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.",

            "In the past two decades, pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused epidemic infections, including the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV outbreak in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 and the current Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) outbreak. They typically affect the respiratory tract and cause severe respiratory illnesses.

            "No observed disparities between race, age or gender groups Inconsistent with the study of Zhao et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], we observed no significant difference in ACE2 expression in Caucasian lung tissue samples compared to Asian lung tissue samples in the RNAseq datasets (p-value=0.45, Fig 1A). In the microarray datasets, a higher ACE2 expression was observed in Caucasian samples compared to Asian samples (pvalue=0.001, Fig 1A). Given that the GSE19804 microarray study focused on female nonsmokers while the GSE10072 dataset includes samples from both males and females and both smokers and non-smokers, we believe that the observed disparity may be due to other factors other than race, such as smoking, gender and unknown factors. Therefore, we performed multiple linear regression on multiple independent variables (age, gender, race, smoking status and platform) and found no significant difference between racial groups (pvalue=0.36, Fig. 1B).<br/><br/>Furthermore, we didn\u2019t observe a disparity between age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female) in ACE2 gene expression in each available dataset (Fig. 1C, D). Consistently, multivariate analysis didn\u2019t detect a significant difference between groups of age or gender after other variables (age/gender, race, smoking status and platforms) were adjusted (p-value=0.90 for age, p-value=0.35 for gender, Fig. 1B). We also consistently found no difference between male and female healthy lung tissue samples from GTEx17 (Fig. S2). Smokers especially former smokers have upregulated ACE2 in lung We found a significant higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker (including current smoker and former smoker) samples compared to non-smoker samples in the TCGA (p-value=0.05) and GSE40419 RNA-seq datasets (p-value=0.01, Fig. 2A). Smokers in GSE10072 showed a higher mean of ACE2 gene expression than non-smokers. The difference is not significant (p-value=0.18), which may be due to the small sample size of this study (n=33) with insufficient power to detect the difference. The GSE19804 data which has only non-smoker samples available was not included into the analysis. Adjusted by other factors (age, gender, race and platforms) in multivariate analysis, smoking still shows a significant disparity in ACE2 gene expression (p-value=0.01, Fig. 1B). These data were from the normal lung tissue of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, which may be different with the lung tissue of healthy people. Therefore, we also analyzed a gene expression dataset of airway epithelium from healthy smokers and healthy non-smokers. Consistently, we observed a significant upregulation of ACE2 gene expression in both large airway epithelium and small airway epithelium of smokers (p-value=4.99E-4 and 7.02E-3, respectively, Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we investigated ordinal categorized smoking history (non-smoker, former smoker quit more than 15yrs, former smoker quit less than15yrs, and current smoker) and showed results in Figure 2B. In the TCGA dataset, we found a significant trend of ACE2 gene expression regulation associated with the smoking history that current smokers had the highest expression, non-smokers had the lowest expression and former smokers had that inbetween (ordinal regression p-value=0.01, Fig. 2B). We found a similar but non-significant trend in the GSE10072 due to its small size (ordinal regression p-value=0.11). We didn\u2019t observe such a tread in the TCGA dataset. Instead, we found a higher average expression in recent quitters (<=15 years) compared to non-smokers, current smokers and former smokers who have quit for longer durations (>15 years). This may indicate a difference in ACE2 gene expression between Caucasian and Asian current smokers, but it is not statistically significantly detected due to the limited sample size in this study (p-value=0.43). Compared to non-smokers, multivariate analysis on all data showed a significant higher ACE2 expression in former smokers (p-value=0.04) and a higher mean of ACE2 expression in current smokers, which did not reach statistical significance from current analysis though (p-value=0.11). Smokers have upregulated ACE2 in remodelled cell types Duclos G et.al. studied human bronchial epithelial cells using single-cell RNA sequencing and found smokers showed a remodeled cell composition in bronchial epithelium with a loss of club cells and extensive hyperplasia of goblet cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] We confirmed their analysis in this study based on the same set of cell makers, including KRT5 for basal cells, FOXJ1 for ciliated cells, SCGB1A1 for club cells, MUC5AC for goblet cells and CD45 for WBCs (white blood cells) (Fig. 3A,C, Fig. S3).

            "In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn\u2019t find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker\u2019s lung compared to non-smoker\u2019s lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.",

            "In the past two decades, pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused epidemic infections, including the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV outbreak in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 and the current Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) outbreak. They typically affect the respiratory tract and cause severe respiratory illnesses. We have learned from SARS-Cov and MERSCov that human populations showed disparities in susceptibility to these viruses. For example, epidemiology studies found that males had higher incidence and mortality rates than females.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] We believe that the susceptibility to the novel 2019-nCov is also different among population groups. In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care.",
            "Recently, Xu et.al. computationally modelled protein interactions and identified a putative cell entry receptor of 2019-nCov, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is also a receptor for SARS-nCov.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Zhou et.al. further confirmed this virus receptor in the HELA cell line.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Interestingly, Zhao et al found ACE2 is specifically expressed in a subset of type II alveolar cells (AT2), in which genes regulating viral reproduction and transmission are highly expressed.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] They also found that an Asian male had much higher ratio of ACE2-expressing cell than other seven white and African American donors, which may indicate the higher susceptibility of Asian. However, the sample size was too small to draw conclusion on this racial disparity. Here, we analyzed four large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. Also, we analyzed two lung tissue single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the distribution of ACE2 gene expression among cell types, which will provide new knowledge for understanding the mechanism and population disparities of 2019-nCov infection."

        "Introduction": [
            "In the past two decades, pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused epidemic infections, including the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV outbreak in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 and the current Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) outbreak.",
            "They typically affect the respiratory tract and cause severe respiratory illnesses.",
            "In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care"
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "Two RNA-seq datasets and two DNA microarray datasets from lung cancer patients were analyzed in this study, including a Caucasian RNA-seq dataset from TCGA, an Asian RNA-seq dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number GSE404196, an Asian microarray dataset from GEO with the accession number GSE198047 and a Caucasian microarray dataset from GEO with the accession number GSE100728",
            "Both RNA-seq datasets were generated with the Illumina HiSeq platform and both microarray datasets were generated with the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Array.",
            "The means of data values across samples in datasets from the same platform were highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.9 for microarray datasets and r=0.97 for RNA-seq datasets, Fig. S1), indicating no significant system variation in datasets from the same platform"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "No observed disparities between race, age or gender groups Inconsistent with the study of Zhao et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], the authors observed no significant difference in ACE2 expression in Caucasian lung tissue samples compared to Asian lung tissue samples in the RNAseq datasets (p-value=0.45, Fig 1A).",
            "The authors found a higher average expression in recent quitters (<=15 years) compared to non-smokers, current smokers and former smokers who have quit for longer durations (>15 years)",
            "This may indicate a difference in ACE2 gene expression between Caucasian and Asian current smokers, but it is not statistically significantly detected due to the limited sample size in this study (p-value=0.43).",
            "The authors found ACE2 is mainly expressed in goblet cells in current smokers and club cells in non-smokers (Fig. 3B), indicating 2019-nCov may infect different cell types in bronchial epithelium of current smokers and non-smokers"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "The authors investigated the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression by analyzing bulk and single-cell transcriptome data.",
            "The authors found significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in lung tissue of former smokers compared to that of non-smokers.",
            "This may explain the reason why more males (56% of 425 cases) were found in a recent epidemiology report of 2019-nCov early transmission by China CDC18.",
            "The authors didn\u2019t observe significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups.",
            "The different is not statistically significant in this study but may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction"
