        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of 2019-nCoV infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease. \nMethods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources.\nResults: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end.\nConclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.",

        "Methods": [
            "The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "1. Meteorological conditions of onset of 2019-nCoV outbreak The outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)",
            "has been reported in Wuhan since December 15. Considering the virus reproduction and disease incubation, we chose the period from Oct 1 to Dec 15 as subject for meteorological analysis.",
            "In Oct, 2019, Wuhan entered winter with a stable winter climate, and the comparison of climates in Wuhan between 2019 and same period in previous years was showed in Table 1. The mean temperature in Wuhan from October to December in 2019 was 14.86 \u00b0C, which was 1.57 \u00b0C higher than that in 2015 and 0.64 \u00b0C higher than that in 2018. As shown in Table 2, there were 6 cooling processes in the winter of 2019, however, none lasted for more than 7 days. The impact of cooling process on the mean temperature was not significant.",
            "From October to December 2019, the mean humidity in Wuhan was 75.26% with significantly less precipitation, both of which were much lower than those in the same period in the previous years.",
            "The relatively warm and dry condition may provide favorable meteorological conditions for the survival and reproduction of the virus.",
            "2. Meteorological conditions of the onset of SARS pneumonia in 2003 On November 16, 2003, the first case of SARS was reported in Shunde district, Foshan city, and later the infection rapidly spread in Guangzhou city, Guangdong Province. Shunde district is close to Guangzhou city with a 10-km distance, and the climate of two locations are very similar. This explains why the SARS spread to Guangzhou after its onset in Shunde, so we chose Guangzhou city as the subject to conduct a retrospective analysis on the meteorological conditions before (from October 1 to November 15, 2003) and after (from November 16 to December 31) the onset of SARS.",
            "Table 3 showed that from October 1 to November 15, 2002, the mean temperature of Guangzhou remained above 24 \u00b0C and the mean humidity remained at about 73%; from November 16th to December 31st, the temperature of Guangzhou maintained at approximately 16.2 \u00b0C and the humidity maintained at approximately 76%. With a relatively stable temperature, SARS in Guangzhou spread from the vector to people and from person to person during this period.",
            "On March 15, 2003, the first case of SARS occurred in Beijing. As shown in Table 3, the mean temperature in Beijing in February was only 0.91 \u00b0C, which was very unsuitable for \u00b0C \u00b0C the survival of coronavirus, and the mean humidity was 51.57%. The mean temperature in",
            "March was 6.33 , and the mean temperature during the day was 12 . At this time, the low ambient temperature was still not conducive for a large-scale transmission of the coronavirus.",
            "\u00b0C By mid-March, the ambient temperature in Beijing further increased. Although the mean temperature of the first half of March was 9.59 , the mean temperature in daytime reached 14.03 \u00b0C, which was basically suitable for the survival and reproduction of the coronavirus. The mean monthly temperature in April rose to 15.29 \u00b0C. During April, the large-scale reproduction of the SARS virus started, and the number of cases of SARS patients kept growing rapidly. The number of patients reached 339 by April 20, and surged to 1,440 by April 30.",
            "3. Comparison of meteorological conditions of the onset of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in 2019 and SARS pneumonia in 2003 As shown in Figure 1, from October to November 2019 in Wuhan, the mean temperature in Wuhan dropped from 18.28 \u00b0C to 13.43 \u00b0C. Humidity remained between 73.12% and 77.58%, and the first few cases of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia occurred in early December. The meteorological conditions significantly overlapped with those of SARS onset in Guangzhou. In the winter of 2002, the temperature was between 13.85\u00b0C to 15.85 \u00b0C, and humidity kept between 69.05% and 78.91% in Guangzhou. Considering the data above including 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, SARS coronavirus in Guangzhou and Beijing, we speculate that a meteorological condition with temperature between 13-19\u00b0C and humidity between 50% and 80% is suitable for the survival and transmission of the coronavirus.",
            "Figure 2B showed that by May 30, 2003, the number of cases in Beijing remained at 5,321. During the following 21 days, only two new cases were reported, and no new \u00b0C confirmed cases reported after June 20. It means the spread of SARS virus has completely subsided. We chose the mean temperature from June 1 to June 20 (24.22 ) as an effective temperature for suppressing virus.",
            "\u00b0C Based on the above data, we found that when the mean temperature reaches 24.22 \u00b0C 26.26 , the transmission of SARS between patients began to significantly decrease or \u00b0C completely cease. Therefore, with reference to the 2003 SARS virus spreading timeline, the month with a mean temperature of 24.22 is expected to be the time of 2019-nCoV pneumonia calming down.",
            "\u00b0C the mean temperature from April 20 to May 10 (26.26 ) were chosen as an effective B: temperature for suppressing virus. No new case of SARS was reported in Beijing after 20 \u00b0C June, and we chose the mean temperature from June 1 to June 20 (24.22 ) as effective temperature for suppressing virus.",
            "5. Global prediction of epidemic trends of 2019-nCoV pneumonia 5.1 Prediction of epidemic trends of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in China \u00b0C \u00b0C According to the national monthly mean temperature distribution data, with the temperature rises in spring, the 13 isotherm gradually moves north. In February, the 13 isotherm can reach the southwest of Chongqing, central Hunan, central Jiangxi, and southern Zhejiang.",
            "\u00b0C In March, the 13 isotherm can reach central Shaanxi, northern Henan, close to southern \u00b0C Hebei. In April, the 13 isotherm can reach southern Beijing. In May, apart from the",
            "Sichuan Basin, the temperature in other areas can rise to 16 \u00b0C or above. The 16-20 \u00b0C isotherm reaches central and southern Inner Mongolia, and Beijing will be completely covered by the 24 \u00b0C isotherm.",
            "According to the analysis above, in the coming February-April, as the temperature gradually rises from low latitudes to high latitudes, and people move to large urban clusters such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Beijing-Tianjin, and the Pearl River Delta, where the mean temperature is between 13 \u00b0C to 19 \u00b0C, the new coronavirus may break out in these urban agglomerations. Figure 3A showed the geographical prediction of infection spread of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in China.",
            "Figure 3B showed the national mean temperature distribution in May, and we found that the area east of the Hu Huan Yong line, which is the most densely populated region in China, is basically under 24\u00b0C climate coverage, and the area is China's most important urban agglomerations, also the China's most important population input area, and includes China Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei City Group, Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan City Group, East China Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai City Group, and South China Pearl River Delta Group. So, 2020 May is expected to be the time for 2019-nCoV pneumonia to enter a recession period. A",
            "From the global mean temperature distribution maps in Figure 4, we can identify the \u00b0C \u00b0C global impact of this 2019-nCoV pneumonia. From February to the end of May, 2020, the areas covered by the temperature (13 -24 ) indicated in the red rectangular are all key areas for disease prevention, especially densely populated cities; from June and thereafter, the disease in regions with a mean temperature over 24 \u00b0C will begin to subside.",
            "Prior to June, 2020, cities with a global average temperature below 24 \u00b0C are all under high-risk of the transmission of new coronaviruses (Figure 4). Aviation departments and ports in various countries need to strictly monitor and prevent the spread of the virus. After June, the risk of disease transmission will be significantly reduced in the cities with a mean temperature reaching 24 \u00b0C or higher."
        ],
        "Conclusions": [
            "A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 \u00b0C are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.",

            "2019-nCoV has a high basic case reproduction number (R0 ranges from 2.2 to 6.7)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], causing much more infections than SARS.

            "Zhou et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] found that coronavirus is probably most active between 9 \u00b0C and 24 \u00b0C, when the average daily temperature in summer is higher than 24 \u00b0C, the possibility of SARS outbreak will decrease. It is consistent with our prediction on the control period of coronavirus. They thought the minimum temperature of coronavirus survival is 9\u00b0C, which is lower than 13\u00b0C in our study. The difference may come from the Beijing data. In March 2003, the monthly mean temperature was 6.33\u00b0C, and the mean temperature from March 16 to March 31 increased to 9.59\u00b0C, during which the SARS patients increased. However, by further analysis, we found the mean temperature in day from March 16 to March 31 reached 14.03\u00b0C, more closed to that of the onset of SARS in 2002 winter in Guangzhou. April 2003 was the increase period of SARS patient, and it had a monthly mean temperature of 15.29\u00b0C, but the day mean temperature from April 1 to April 15 was 13.41\u00b0C, a decrease of 1.88\u00b0C, so we concluded that the minimum temperature of coronavirus survival is 13\u00b0C based on the above analysis.",
            "Warm and dry weather conditions have led to an increase in atmospheric suspended matter, providing conditions for virus adhesion, breeding and transmission. Wuhan had a warm winter of 2019 with a mean temperature of 14.86 \u00b0C from October 1 to December 15, which was higher than that of the same period in 2015-2018. Although there were 6 times of cooling event, the cooling process was short with no cooling process being more than 7 days. Because of the short time of cooling, the cold air had no positive effects on the inhibition or killing of virus; on the contrary, it aggravated the infection for the following possible reasons: 1) Cold air can decrease the nasopharyngeal temperature from 36.9\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C11, providing suitable survival and reproduction conditions for coronavirus; 2) Cold air causes vasoconstriction of respiratory tract, further to reduce the immunoglobulin secreted by the mucosa; 3) Dry cold air makes the nasal mucosa prone to small rupture, and creates opportunities for virus invasion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In the same period of previous years, a long period of low temperature played a good role in killing the coronavirus. Lower rainfall and therefore reduced relative humidity provide a good opportunity for the transmission of respiratory pathogen infections, including coronavirus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Guangzhou had no precipitation for exactly one month before the SARS outbreak at the end of 2002. Precipitation in Wuhan also significantly decreased before the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Although the average monthly humidity of Wuhan from October to December, 2019 was between 69% -77%. The precipitation was significantly reduced to 74 mm, only equivalent to 33.58% of 2015, 37.99% of 2016, and 61.16% of 2018. And the humidity remained at around 50% during the outbreak in Beijing.",

            "In conclusion, through the analysis of the meteorological conditions for onset of 2019nCoV and SARS coronavirus, we found that: (1) A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of the virus with a temperature range of 13-24 \u00b0C, a humidity range of 50% -80%, a precipitation of 30 mm / month or less. Cold air for more than a week has a significant inhibitory effect on coronavirus. (2) In the coming Feb and",

The regions with a mean temperature of 13-19\u00b0C include the most densely populated areas in the Mainland China, like the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai area and other middle-high latitude urban agglomerations. It is therefore necessary to intensify the disease prevention and control in these areas, especially in transportation hub cities. In south China, the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration should be the focus of disease prevention.

        "Figure 3B showed the national mean temperature distribution in May, and we found that the area east of the Hu Huan Yong line, which is the most densely populated region in China, is basically under 24\u00b0C climate coverage, and the area is China's most important urban agglomerations, also the China's most important population input area, and includes China Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei City Group, Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan City Group, East China Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai City Group, and South China Pearl River Delta Group",
        "By further analysis, we found the mean temperature in day from March 16 to March 31 reached 14.03\u00b0C, more closed to that of the onset of SARS in 2002 winter in Guangzhou",
        "Through the analysis of the meteorological conditions for onset of 2019nCoV and SARS coronavirus, we found that: (1) A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of the virus with a temperature range of 13-24 \u00b0C, a humidity range of 50% -80%, a precipitation of 30 mm / month or less"
