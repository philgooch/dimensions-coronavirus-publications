            "In conclusion, based solely on the observed number of cases so far, the current case count for 2019 nCoV in the United States currently supports subcritical transmission because the upper limit of Ris less than one. This result holds even when a high degree of heterogeneity is permitted (e.g. a dispersion of 0.3). However, it is too early to make a definitive statement about subcriticality because there may still be cases that are pre-symptomatic. This simple approach for assessing whether subcritical transmission is plausible may be applicable to other diseases, such as avian influenza, with low case counts."
