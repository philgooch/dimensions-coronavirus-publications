        "abstract": "Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 - 7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.",

            "The travellers in this study represent a selective sample of the reported cases. We found travellers to be more often male and younger than the cases reported. The numbers are too small to detect systematic differences in incubation time with age or sex. Because we only have information on confirmed cases, there is likely a bias towards more severe cases in areas with a functioning health care system. As the epidemic continues, it remains important to collect more information on incubation periods of 2019-nCoV cases of older ages, of persons with underlying morbidity, of women, and of persons with mild symptoms.",
            "There are various choices one can make about the parametric form of the incubation period distribution. The results with the three often-used forms we report here suggest that there is little impact on the mean and dispersion of the incubation periods. Of these three, the lognormal distribution assigns higher probabilities to longer incubation periods. Although we found that this distribution provided a poorer description of the data than the Weibull and the gamma distributions, it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic.",
            "Our study helps in choosing an appropriate duration for quarantine. Keeping infected persons in quarantine up to 14 days will ensure that they do not develop symptoms after release."
