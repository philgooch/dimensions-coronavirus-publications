        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nBACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China.\n\nMETHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. \n\nRESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6311, p&lt;0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6358, p&lt;0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p&lt;0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p&lt;0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p&lt;0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p&lt;0.01) among the confirmed cases.\n\nCONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.",

Data of global COVID-19 cases were collected from WHO. It included the daily new and cumulative cases of confirmed patients, cured patients, and deaths. All cases included detailed epidemiological history and the dates at which incidents occurred.

            "Data on population movement were retrieved from the Chinese Lunar New Year Travel Information, which was released daily by Baidu Migration Map (http://qianxi.baidu.com).

The daily growth rate of secondary cases was calculated as new secondary daily cases divided by the cumulative number of the day before. The lag time between primary and secondary cases was identified by using the displacement with the highest correlation from the cross-correlation result.",

            "In both 2019 and 2020, the daily population outflow from Hubei started to rise steadily for 7-10 days before the Lunar New Year\u2019s Day (Jan 25th, 2020) (Fig. 2A). However, starting on Jan 20th, 2020, there was a sudden surge in the outflow index when it was acknowledged publicly by the government the fact of human-to-human transmission. In contrast, there has been a dramatic decrease in the outflow index since Jan 26th, 2020, compared with that of 2019, following the total lockdown of most cities, first in Wuhan and then elsewhere, in Hubei province (Fig. 2A).",
            "We correlated the daily inflow index of 30 provincial areas and 51 cities in 18 of these provinces with the number of reported total or primary cases in the same areas and found a very strong correlation both at province and city levels.

We found although daily growth rate varied among different provincial areas, some of them had common characteristics (Fig. 3B). Based on the daily growth rate of secondary cases we further divided study regions into three categories. In the first group the maximum values for daily growth rates were all <1.5, including Beijing, Guangdong, and Chongqing (Fig. 3C).",

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "This study presented detailed analyses of time trends of COVID-19 epidemic across different parts of China and their associations with population movement, public health emergency measures, and medical resources. We showed that the rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic across China was strongly associated with the mass population movement out of Hubei province, particularly Wuhan city, before the Chinese Lunar New year, which was subsequently disrupted effectively by the total lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei provinces. Although there were variations in the pace of control across different regions of China, the epidemic outside of Hubei province was contained rapidly and effectively through various public health emergency measures. As well as public health measures, local capacity including the number of public health staff and available medical resources also played important roles in control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.",
            "The first case of novel COVID-19 infection was reported during early December 2019 and it was not publicly acknowledged until 20 January 2020 that the virus could be transmitted from human to human, which triggered rapid and drastic public health measures both in Hubei and rest of China to try to contain the spread of virus. The total lockdown of Wuhan city on 23rd January 2020, followed by other cities in Hubei a few days later, appeared too late to prevent the epidemic from spreading into other regions of China, for by then over 5 million people had already left Wuhan. However, without such drastic measures, the situation could be much worse. The data from Baidu Migration",
            "Map showed that mass population movements out of Wuhan and Hubei province took place not only before but throughout the whole of Chinese Lunar New Year period. Based on comparison with 2019 data, without lockdown an additional 15 million people could have traveled from Wuhan to other regions (and overseas) plus similar or even larger number who would have travelled from other regions to Wuhan. Moreover, there would have been massive internal population movement within",
            "Wuhan and other cities in Hubei during the same period, further exacerbating the epidemic.",
            "Expectedly the severity of COVID-19 epidemic outside of Hubei province, especially during the initial phase, was strongly related to the scale of inward population movements from Wuhan.",
            "However, the epidemic was rapidly brought under control in most areas by introduction of various public health emergency measures, as demonstrated by decrease of the daily number of confirmed cases starting from the 1st or 2nd week of February and the lack of clear correlation between S/P ratio and number of total confirmed cases. Despite this, the pace with which the epidemic was contained varied across different areas as assessed by various parameters examined, including S/P ratio, the daily growth rate of secondary cases and lag time. For example, in Guangdong and Beijing, both of which were badly affected by SARS outbreak in 2003, the epidemic was effectively contained at very early stage, suggesting adequate level of local preparedness and experience in dealing with such epidemics. Similarly, in Zhejiang province, doctors can pre-screen suspected patient through the internet application, which greatly reduce the probability of hospital transmission. Moreover, using cloud computing facilities and integrated big data platform, public health doctors in Zhejiang province was also able to cross-examine every suspected case. These measures have contributed importantly to a sharp and continual downward trend in the number infected after Jan 30th, 2020. On the other hand, in several other areas (eg, Heilongjiang and Tianjin) there were prolonged delays in containing the epidemic, reflecting probably less effective local measures in controlling the epidemic.",
            "For example, in Heilongjiang, the S/P ratio approached 11, which was the highest across all regions outside of Hubei, suggesting nearly 90 percent of the confirmed cases resulted from family gatherings.",
            "The regional variations in the pace of epidemic containment was also evident by comparison of the mean lag time between primary and secondary cases. Overall the mean lag time was about 1 week, with particularly low value in Jiangsu (~ 4 days) and Henan (~5 days), and particularly high value in",
            "Heilongjiang (~13 days) and Tianjin (~17 days). Henan is a neighboring province of Hubei with a total population of 100 million people and extensive transport connections with Wuhan. In recognition of forthcoming epidemic, the Henan provincial government introduced strong measures to greatly reduce and restrict public transport from Wuhan areas into Henan even before the total lockdown of the Wuhan city.",
            "Although the COVID-19 shared many similar epidemiological features to those of SARS in 200316, it appeared to be much less deadly[20,21], with the overall case fatality rate of less than 3% as opposed to ~10% for SARS. However, there was great difference in the case fatality rates between Hubei, particularly Wuhan and rest of the China. As the epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak, medical and health services in Hubei Province were overwhelmed and ill prepared for such a rapid and substantial increase in the number of infected cases, leading to poor and inadequate management of patients, hence poor prognosis. Apart from difference in the capacity of medical services, other factors, including age of people affected and proportion with other comorbidities may also contribute to the higher case fatality observed in Wuhan and Hubei. However, without detailed clinical data from individual patients, we were not able to examine these issues directly. It is also possible that a large number of minor cases were not promptly detected or diagnosed in Wuhan and Hubei, resulting in higher case-fatality rate. Indeed, as the medical service started to improve gradually and large number of cases were properly diagnosed the case fatality rates had started to decreased steadily over the last two weeks. Outside of Hubei, although the case fatality rates were very low, we also found a significant correlation between health scores and overall prognosis of patients. In recognizing the burden of epidemic in Hubei province and need for providing prompt and adequate medical service to those infected, the Chinese government has created a \u201cprovince to city\u201d support system, in which each city in Hubei province received direct and targeted support from at least one appointed province.",
            "In summary the present study showed that the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (and elsewhere in other countries) could be attributed primarily to the mass population movement from",
            "Hubei prior to the Chinese Lunar New Year. Subsequently, effective governmental health emergency measures introduced both in Hubei and elsewhere have played important roles in rapid and effective control of the epidemic in China. Although many other unmeasured factors, such as local climates and characteristic of individuals affected, may explain part of our findings, the present study also provided good evidence that adequate levels of investments in public health (eg, number of public health staff) and medical resources can lead to improved control of epidemic and better prognosis of the infected individuals. Despite the rapid improvement, the COVID-19 epidemic in China and elsewhere is not yet over and vigorous public health measures are still warranted in order to totally eliminate the epidemic.",
