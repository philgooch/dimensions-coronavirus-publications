        "abstract": "Since the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased. As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea. Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.",

            "This is the first study to report estimates of the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Korea based on the trajectory of the epidemic, which was reconstructed by using the dates of onset of the first reported cases in Korea. The estimates of R clearly indicate sustained transmission of the novel coronavirus in Korea. Moreover, the imported cases contribute little to the secondary disease transmission in Korea, as majority of these cases occurred in the early phase of the epidemic, with the most recent imported case reported on February 9, 2020. These findings support the range of social distancing interventions that the Korean government put in place in order to bring the outbreak under control as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Our estimates of the reproduction number can be compared with earlier estimates reported for the epidemic in China where the estimates of R lie in the range 2-7.1 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>].

        "Methods": [
            "Data The authors obtained the daily series of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea from January 20, 2020 to February, 26, 2020 that are publicly available from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "All of the dates of symptoms onset are available for the imported cases",
            "The authors utilize this empirical distribution of reporting delays from the onset to diagnosis to impute the missing dates of onset for the remainder of the cases with missing data.",
            "The authors reconstruct 300 epidemic curves by dates of symptoms onset from which the authors derived a mean incidence curve of local case incidence and drop the last three data points from the analysis to adjust for reporting delays in the real-time analysis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Reconstructed incidence of COVID-19 The reconstructed daily incidence curve of COVID-19 after the imputing the onset dates for the Korean cases is shown in Figure 1.",
            "Effective reproduction number ( ) from daily case incidence Under the empirical reporting delay distribution from Korean cases with available dates of onset, the intrinsic growth rate (r) was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.5, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter (p).",
            "This largest cluster is associated with Shincheonji Church of Jesus, with the first case confirmed on Feb. 18",
            "It is unclear how this case contracted the illness, as she does not present a recent history of travel or contact with another infected patient.",
            "The Shincheonji church of Jesus has temporarily closed its facilities and halted the church activities as of February 18, 2020"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "This is the first study to report estimates of the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Korea based on the trajectory of the epidemic, which was reconstructed by using the dates of onset of the first reported cases in Korea.",
            "The imported cases contribute little to the secondary disease transmission in Korea, as majority of these cases occurred in the early phase of the epidemic, with the most recent imported case reported on February 9, 2020",
            "These findings support the range of social distancing interventions that the Korean government put in place in order to bring the outbreak under control as soon as possible."
