        "abstract": "An ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infection outbreak called COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective.\nWe have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19.\nCountries' vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries' management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.",

            "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection pneumonia outbreak<br/><br/>COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChan_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rChan_et+al_2020_a\">Chan et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a></a></a>; Munster, Koopmans, van Doremalen, van Riel, & de Wit, 2020). It spread rapidly to all provinces throughout China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a></a></a>; WHO, 2020). Thus far (February 2020), the epidemic has not decelerated but has started breaking out internationally. For example, cluster outbreaks have occurred in Singapore, Japan, and on international cruise ships (e.g. the Diamond Princess). With the exception of China, countries are at the most critical stage to avoid outbreaks of domestic cluster infections.<br/><br/>Many studies or reports have started revealing that SARS-CoV-2 is very infectious (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a></a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020</a>) Many clinical cases are asymptomatic or mildly diagnosed patients (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2020_a\">Liu, Liao, Chang, Chou, & Lin, 2020</a>), which greatly increases the potential for transmission and makes epidemic prevention very difficult."

            "<strong>Methods a</strong><br/><br/>Data<br/><br/>The original laboratory-confirmed cases data is collected from the WHO situation reports of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020) and the Center for Systems Science and<br/><br/>Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHUCSSE, 2020) for<br/><br/>2020/1/21\u20132020/2/12.

            "COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective.",
            "We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country\u2019s vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19.",
            "Countries\u2019 vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country\u2019s vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries\u2019 management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic.",

It spread rapidly to all provinces throughout China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a></a>; WHO, 2020). Thus far (February 2020), the epidemic has not decelerated but has started breaking out internationally. For example, cluster outbreaks have occurred in Singapore, Japan, and on international cruise ships (e.g. the Diamond Princess). With the exception of China, countries are at the most critical stage to avoid outbreaks of domestic cluster infections.",
            "Many studies or reports have started revealing that SARS-CoV-2 is very infectious (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020</a>) Many clinical cases are asymptomatic or mildly diagnosed patients (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2020_a\">Liu, Liao, Chang, Chou, & Lin, 2020</a>), which greatly increases the potential for transmission and makes epidemic prevention very difficult.",
            "Therefore, it will likely evolve into a global pandemic of epidemic disease in the future.",
            "Many countries have started implementing measures to prevent the epidemic spreading in their countries, including stopping flights from China, quarantining at airports, suspending visas for Chinese citizens, issuing travel warnings to China and advising citizens not to visit China unless necessary, and implementing home quarantine or stopping the entry and transfer of foreign tourists who have traveled to China within 14 days to prevent imported cases after overseas traveling. However, since many countries have very close business or human relationships with China, it is impossible to avoid imported cases. Therefore, to understand the initial transmission of novel infectious diseases, we must first understand each country\u2019s connectivity to the country of origin, which is the first step for countries around the world to prevent the first stage of overseas imported cases.",
            "Since the outbreak, we all want to know how COVID-19 will spread from Wuhan all across China and further from China to all around the world in terms of both time and space. A previous study made preliminary estimations and predictions through a typical infectious disease model called a susceptible\u2013exposed\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SEIR)",

Unknown infectious diseases have made it very difficult to adjust and calibrate the parameters of various prediction models like the SEIR model, making the model predictions very uncertain and restrictive. The totally different pattern of transmission means that all spatiotemporal models or patterns from other coronaviruses such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the Middle",
            "East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are less suitable for use with COVID-19, even if they have highly similar genome sequence identity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLu_et+al_2020_a\">Lu et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cQiao_2020_a\" href=\"#rQiao_2020_a\">Qiao, 2020</a>).

In addition, for the analysis of worldwide countries other than China, we can use the changes in the number of cases that have been widespread in China's provinces to estimate the number of cases worldwide. In other words, except for Hubei Province, where Wuhan is located, the epidemic pattern of China\u2019s provinces precedes that of countries around the world by about 0.5\u20131 months. Thus, this can be used as a dynamic reference basis for case prediction, simulation, and risk analysis in various countries (Figure 1).",

Based on each country\u2019s connectivity to China, medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, and future conditions, different scenarios are generated with which to analyze the potential transmission around the world.

The changes in the case number for each country can be divided into two major stages. The first stage is mainly based on imported cases of immigration from abroad or sporadic cases of local traceable infection sources. The time that the first case happens in each country and the daily number of subsequent cases that continue to occur are based on the country\u2019s Health Care Index and connectivity to the country of outbreak. Here, the country\u2019s vulnerability to outbreak countries for coronavirus is defined as: Vk = \u2211",

            "The higher the Health Care Index, the better the resistance against outbreaks from outbreak countries so we have less vulnerability. Meanwhile, higher connectivity or transmissibility indicates that a country has more interactions and higher human mobility with outbreak countries, which makes the disease more easily transmitted to this country, so it has a higher vulnerability.",
            "We determine the time after the first case in each country based on the weight calculation from the vulnerability. In the first stage, the daily confirmed cases number is determined by a random number based on the historical data distribution of the daily confirmed cases number and vulnerability in each country. In other words, if a country has a high number of confirmed cases during the first stage, it means that the country either lacks adequate medical conditions and epidemic control measures or is highly vulnerable to China. It is very likely that there will be a higher chance of a confirmed case in the future. In our results section, we estimate and calibrate the vulnerability and the number of confirmed cases for each country.",

This is a dynamic process that changes daily with the number of cumulative cases. Since the beginning of the outbreak in January 2020, various countries\u2019 governments have implemented related measures for epidemic prevention such as reducing flights and stopping visas so that many countries with high vulnerability can maintain a small number of cases. The countries below this regression line\u2014including Taiwan, Korea Republic, and Russia\u2014can be regarded as countries with excellent initial epidemic prevention work and Japan and the United States have performed fairly well (unfortunately, Japan starting finding outbreak community infections after this study was completed), whereas Singapore and Thailand are far above the regression line with higher cases and may have higher risk in the future.",

Therefore, the results of simulations applied in other countries show that the cumulated case number increases rapidly at the start for some countries, particularly for countries with higher vulnerability. After one month, the epidemic was controlled and the number of cases in each country no longer increased significantly. Meanwhile, considering the extreme, high, medium, and low simulation levels of the epidemic scenarios in various countries, it can also be seen that after a period of time, namely in April, the case number differences between the scenarios will be clearly comparable. A1 extreme is the highest scenario, followed by B1, C1, and D1. Meanwhile, severe scenarios (Figure 8) are based on the trend that COVID-19 may be like traditional influenza for a global pandemic; that is, cases will continue to occur, which may lead to >10,000 cases in some countries.

            "SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia disease (COVID-19), attempts to understand the impact of vulnerability, and uses this information to simulate the development of the number of potential cases in different countries in the future. In addition, this study compares and quantifies the initial epidemic prevention capabilities and various countries\u2019 management strategies. At present, this study focuses on the spread of risk in space and time, which can be used as early-stage control when a novel infectious disease breaks out. In the future, it should be possible to simulate the changes in the number of recoveries or deaths at the same time to better understand the future risk reduction process. Based on this framework, we can perform the next stage of simulation, continuously modify the risk map, and dynamically update the analysis results. However, there is currently no complete understanding of the characteristics of",
            "COVID-19 around the world. There is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the epidemic will reach its peak and it is unclear whether recovered patients are still infectious.",
            "Although the outbreak occurred in China, the epidemic is still in its initial stage for the whole world. This study is a preliminary estimation and it can be assumed that COVID-",
            "is not controlled by climatic factors or effective drugs. Moreover, many cases with mild symptoms or even asymptomatic cases have appeared clinically, which has made epidemic prevention and modeling very difficult. According to this study\u2019s simulation results, if there is no specific medicine, it will likely form a global pandemic.",
            "Although in this study, we collected the proportion of evacuation charter infection cases in various countries and estimated that the total number of cases in Hubei Province is much larger than the actual official case number, we still adopt a more conservative method that uses the official case number for risk assessment. This is based on the assumption that countries are well-prepared for epidemic prevention. We believe that countries have been prepared and have relevant experience for reference earlier than the period when the Wuhan outbreak started. In the next stage, based on the research framework, we can further superimpose the next outbreak on the global impact such as the localized infection that happened in Singapore, and so on.",
            "The other results of many statistical models will be greatly affected by adjusting the parameters. At the start of an unknown infectious disease outbreak, it is impossible to understand the actual parameters. For example, we have been unable to determine the basic reproductive number, serial interval, etc. These will affect the model\u2019s prediction results and create difficulties in model prediction. In fact, we have also tried to use a data-driven approach to make estimations using machine-learning or deep-learning methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Random Forest method.",
            "However, the preliminary results are poor due to insufficient data and cannot be effectively used for supervised learning.",
            "After completing this study, it was also found that localized outbreaks in Japan and",
            "Singapore had taken the lead, consistent with the vulnerability analysis and risk analysis results in this study. Both Singapore and Japan were among the countries with the highest risk in the simulation results. The first case also occurred in Egypt (risks signal exist in the Egyptian part of the map as of February 20, 2020 in each scenario of Figures and 8). This is consistent with the estimation results in this study."
