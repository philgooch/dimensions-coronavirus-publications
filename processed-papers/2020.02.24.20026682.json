            "In summary, using data of WeChat, a Chinese social media, may early detect the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China in 2019. If WeChat Index for the keyword Feidian were monitored, the outbreak would be detected 2 weeks earlier. Future studies can prospectively gather and analyze data from WeChat to early detect SARS-CoV-2-like outbreaks as well as outbreaks of other diseases in China. Tracing the source of keywords that behave abnormally in frequencies in WeChat, following rapid response, may become a promising approach to control a disease outbreak in its very early stage."

            "By exploring daily data from WeChat, a Chinese social media, we found that the frequencies of several keywords related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease behaved abnormally during a period ahead of the outbreak in China, 2019. Of these keywords, Feidian is especially worthy of attention. In 2003, the SARS outbreak caused mass panic among people in China and approximately half of the victims were health care workers[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Since then, Chinese physicians are alert to SARS and similar diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. If the manifestations and chest images indicate viral pneumonia and similar cases occurs in a region during a short time, they naturally think of SARS that is called Feidian in Chinese language. When suspected cases admitted to hospitals, involved physicians may mention Feidian and communicate in WeChat using this word. As showed in the current study, the activity of Feidian in WeChat began to rise on Dec 15, 2019. According to publications of early cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection, five to eleven patients had symptom onset by this day, with the first onset on Dec 1, 2019[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].

        "Discussion": [
            "By exploring daily data from WeChat, a Chinese social media, we found that the frequencies of several keywords related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease behaved abnormally during a period ahead of the outbreak in China, 2019. Of these keywords, Feidian is especially worthy of attention. In 2003, the SARS outbreak caused mass panic among people in China and approximately half of the victims were health care workers[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Since then, Chinese physicians are alert to SARS and similar diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. If the manifestations and chest images indicate viral pneumonia and similar cases occurs in a region during a short time, they naturally think of SARS that is called Feidian in Chinese language. When suspected cases admitted to hospitals, involved physicians may mention Feidian and communicate in WeChat using this word. As showed in the current study, the activity of Feidian in WeChat began to rise on Dec 15, 2019. According to publications of early cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection, five to eleven patients had symptom onset by this day, with the first onset on Dec 1, 2019[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Furthermore, the activity of Feidian persisted at levels higher than those ahead of Dec 15, 2019 and it dramatically rose to a peak on the day of the outbreak announcement. Altogether, WeChat Index for Feidian is a strong warning sign for the",
            "SARS-Cov-2 outbreak. Using it may early detect the outbreak ahead of two weeks compared with the traditional surveillance systems in China.",
            "The activity of SARS in WeChat was abnormally high in Dec 1 to 3, 2019 compared to the days ahead and after. Data by now shows that the symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. Whether there was an inner link between the word activity in WeChat and early patients is unknown. The activity of novel coronavirus in WeChat was abnormally high on Dec 11, 2019 with an Index value of 400. However, its baseline value of WeChat Index (value equals 0 or 50) was very low compared with those of other keywords (Appendix A). It is unclear whether the abnormality was a signal or a noise. As for keywords related to symptoms such as shortness of breath, dyspnea, and diarrhea, WeChat Index increased in value ahead of 9-13 days of the outbreak announcement. These symptoms are not specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The increases may have some association with emergence of the disease, or just a coincidence. Though lack inner link and not performed that well in detecting the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compared with keyword Feidian, other keywords explored in the study, including those not considered as potential candidates for the outbreak sign, and even keywords not explored in the study (such as the names of drugs treating SARS-CoV-2 infection), may still have value in future outbreak detection and monitoring. Experience from Google Flu Trends showed that a combination of potential keywords other than a single keyword is more successful[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "Gathering and analyzing data from social media, Internet search queries, news wires and web sites represents a novel approach to early warning and detection of disease outbreaks and is a supplementary to traditional surveillance systems[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Such a tool, the Global Public Health",
            "Intelligence Network (GPHIN), identified the early SARS outbreak in China in 2003 more than two months earlier and first alerted the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (known as MERS-CoV) in 2012[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. As far as we know, GPHIN and other established tools do not gather data from WeChat, the dominant Chinese social media. The current study shows that gathering and analyzing data from WeChat may be amazing to early detect disease outbreak. This may have an advantage especially for detecting outbreaks in China considering the population of WeChat users. Previous studies used search query data, including Baidu Index, to monitor the activity of emerging infectious diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. As far as we know, this is the first time to use WeChat data in this field. As the current study indicated, using WeChat data may perform better than using Baidu search query data in early detecting the outbreak of a new disease because people may communicate first in WeChat in the times of WeChat as a lifestyle of Chinese people[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].",
            "The main limitation of the study lies on its retrospective nature. The outbreak is a solitary case. Using WeChat data to early detect outbreaks like this should be valued in the future. In addition, history data of WeChat Index 90 days ago is unavailable and how the index is calculated is not open.",
            "In summary, using data of WeChat, a Chinese social media, may early detect the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China in 2019. If WeChat Index for the keyword Feidian were monitored, the outbreak would be detected 2 weeks earlier. Future studies can prospectively gather and analyze data from WeChat to early detect SARS-CoV-2-like outbreaks as well as outbreaks of other diseases in China. Tracing the source of keywords that behave abnormally in frequencies in WeChat, following rapid response, may become a promising approach to control a disease outbreak in its very early stage.",
