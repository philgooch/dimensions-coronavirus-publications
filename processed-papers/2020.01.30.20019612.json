        "abstract": "The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections. Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus.  We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms.  These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.",

Here, we present direct measurement of rates of seeking clinical care and show that only 4% (6 of 135) of persons shedding seasonal CoV sought care. Reporting rates and rates of seeking medical care may differ, as most individuals visiting a clinician for acute respiratory illness are not tested for seasonal CoV. However, testing for the 2019 nCoV is expected to be more robust than for seasonal CoV as there is pressing need to understand and contain this novel pathogen. This high testing rate could result in the reporting rate for nCoV equaling the rate of seeking medical care. Thus, if rates of seeking medical care for nCoV were to align with seasonal CoV, the reporting rate for nCoV would approach 4%. Should the remaining 96% of unreported infections be sufficiently contagious, their high numbers could support rapid spread of nCoV."

The daily self-report also documented whether participants had sought medical attention, stayed home or taken cold and flu-related medications (both over-the-counter and prescription) as a consequence of their listed symptoms (see [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] for further survey details).",

Should the remaining 96% of unreported infections be sufficiently contagious, their high numbers could support rapid spread of nCoV.",
            "It is important to note that rates of seeking medical care for nCoV may not align with the rates found here for seasonal CoV: concern over the virus may lead to elevated rates of seeking medical care; our estimates for seasonal CoV represent a moderate sample size; and the symptom severity of emergent Wuhan nCoV may differ from seasonal CoV. Further, early outbreak instances of death due to nCoV occurred predominantly in elderly patients, and often elderly with co-morbidities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. The data we present here for seasonal CoV are from a cohort with no individuals 65 year or older, so the findings identified here might not have bearing on the elderly.",
            "Still, several recent studies suggest that reporting rates for nCoV may align with the rates found here for seasonal CoV. Chinazzi et al, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] used an agent-based modeling approach to estimate the overall nCoV incidence (reported and unreported) necessary to support the observed numbers of geographically exported infected individuals as of January 21, 2020. They estimated a 5-16% nCoV reporting rate depending on model assumptions. In addition, phylogenetic analysis has identified Wuhan nCoV as a betacoronavirus, the genus that includes CoV-OC43 and CoV-HKU1, as well as CoVSARS and CoV-MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Among our cohort participants, 7% (6 of 91) of infection episodes with seasonal betacoronavirus (OC43 and HKU1) sought medical care.",
            "The impact of unrecognized and unattended infections on transmission dynamics is likely a key determinant of whether control of the nCoV outbreak is possible. For example, although cases of seroconversion without sign of disease were documented during the SARS outbreak, asymptomatic and subclinical rates are believed to have been low. No cases of asymptomatic SARS transmission were documented [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], which may have facilitated the containment of the epidemic.",
            "A higher asymptomatic ratio was reported for MERS infections, which presented with a broader spectrum of clinical manifestations: 21% of laboratory identified cases were mild or asymptomatic and 48% had severe disease or died [10]. The potential for asymptomatic transmission of MERS has been reported [11]; however, the majority of transmission events happened within hospital or household, suggesting that close proximity may have facilitated transmission.",
            "nCoV has spread rapidly in a short time, which suggests a substantial number of unreported infections exist. The results presented here provide a unique direct measure of seasonal CoV infection, symptom severity, and rates of seeking medical care. These findings provide a baseline reference for contextualizing nCoV pandemic potential."
