        "abstract": "Since its debut in mid-December, 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread from its origin in Wuhan, China, to several countries across the globe, leading to a global health crisis. As of February 7, 2020, 44 strains of the virus have been sequenced and uploaded to NCBI\u2019s GenBank [1], providing insight into the virus\u2019s evolutionary history and pathogenesis. Here, we present the WashU Virus Genome Browser, a web-based portal for viewing virus genomic data. The browser is home to 16 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences, together with hundreds of related viral sequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus. In addition, the browser features unique customizability, supporting user-provided upload of novel viral sequences in various formats. Sequences can be viewed in both a track-based representation as well as a phylogenetic tree-based view, allowing the user to easily compare sequence features across multiple strains. The WashU Virus Genome Browser inherited many features and track types from the WashU Epigenome Browser, and additionally incorporated a new type of SNV track to address the specific needs of viral research. Our Virus Browser portal can be accessed at https://virusgateway.wustl.edu, and documentation is available at https://virusgateway.readthedocs.io/.",

            "On December 12, 2019, the first case of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in<br/><br/>Wuhan, China, and by February 6, 2020, the virus spread to 24 additional countries, infecting more than 27,000 individuals and resulting in 565 fatalities, according to the World Health<br/><br/>Organization (WHO) [2]. The 2019-nCoV is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, which is one of four genera of coronaviruses of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family<br/><br/>Coronaviridae, of the order Nidovirales [3, 4]. The species in this genus are enveloped, contain a positive single-stranded RNA genome, and are of zoonotic, likely bat, origins [5]. 2019-nCoV is one of the largest RNA virus genomes varying from 27kb to 32kb in size, with this particular strain ringing in at 29,903 bps long [6]. The virus is one of 7 coronaviruses known to infect humans, and along with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 2019-nCoV is one of the species responsible for severe respiratory distress in humans as well as other animals [4]. In an effort to better understand the pathogenesis of this family of viruses, several groups have sequenced individual strains, providing a powerful resource hosted by NCBI.<br/><br/>The WashU Epigenome Browser is a powerful tool for visualizing multiple functional genomic datasets and data types simultaneously [5-8]. The general layout of the Epigenome Browser displays the genome on the x-axis, and individual tracks encompassing many different varieties can be loaded and viewed in the context of the genome and accompanying metadata. Recent updates to the browser have incorporated new functionality, including live browsing, greatly enhancing its functionality [5]. With this powerful tool in-hand, we sought to adapt the browser for use of visualizing viral genomes, to support more efficient research and more rapid knowledge dissemination in response to the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak. To accomplish this, we created the WashU Virus Genome Browser, adapted from the WashU Epigenome Browser."

            "Organization of the Virus Genome Browser<br/><br/>The WashU Virus Genome Browser houses consensus reference genomic sequences for 4 different pathogenic virus species: 2019-nCoV, MERS, SARS, and Ebola, as well as a comprehensive set of genome assemblies for the individual strains of each virus (16, 551, 332, and 1574, respectively). When users first navigate to the WashU Virus Browser and select \u201cBrowse Data\u201d, they are directed to a page with several customizable options, including a dropdown menu from which they may choose a reference genome [Figure 1]. Corresponding with the reference genome selected, a metadata table is displayed containing sortable features such as species, strain, isolate, isolation source, host, country, and collection date, to allow for quick and easy sorting of individual strains. The user may select viral isolates from the metadata table to be visualized in one of our two displayable platforms: the track view (green arrow, Figures 2 and 3) or the phylogenetic tree view (orange arrow, Figures 4 and 5).    The Track View<br/><br/>The track view option has a standard genome browser layout similar to that of the WashU<br/><br/>Epigenome Browser, in which a reference genome sequence is visualized as a sliding window.<br/><br/>Various annotation data tracks are hosted on the browser and can be loaded for visualization in a genomic context. For each virus, we downloaded publicly available annotations of the reference genome and converted these annotations into refBed tracks that can be visualized in the genome browser. Likewise, immune epitopes identified in SARS were aligned to the 2019nCoV reference [Materials and Methods], and a track displaying their coordinates in 2019-nCoV is provided. GC-density tracks were also created for each reference genome, and display the percentage of Gs (Guanines) and Cs (Cytosines) per 5bp window. An entropy track [Materials and Methods] showing the degree of sequence diversity at each position and a diversity track [Materials and Methods] showing the percentage of each of the 4 nucleotides at each position across all strains of the given virus species are also included in the database. In addition to hosting 4 virus species reference genomes, The Virus Genome Browser also supports displaying user-specified genomes provided in FASTA format, as shown in the top left part of"

            "Maps help us understand the world around us and navigate it. Moreover, they play a critical role in disaster management during disease outbreaks. Herein, we describe the first genetic mapping, exploration, and visualization tool from the WashU Epigenome Browser team that is specifically dedicated to viral genomes. We provide reference genome maps and genomic datasets related to 4 viral disease outbreaks: SARS (2002-03), MERS (2012), Ebola (2014-16)<br/><br/>and the latest nCoV (2019-20). More importantly, we not only present publicly available information in the format of easily accessible data tracks, but also offer a platform with high customizability and flexibility where individual investigators and teams can upload and visualize their own genomic datasets in a plethora of formats. In this report, we have demonstrated using the Virus Browser to 1) quickly and intuitively compare multiple viral genomes and study the viral genome at multiple levels [Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 5]; and 2) combine viral genome information with other functional genomic information (amino acid sequence and putative immune epitope locations, as shown Figure 3) through multiple track types the browser supports, and identify potential therapeutic targets."

The species in this genus are enveloped, contain a positive single-stranded RNA genome, and are of zoonotic, likely bat, origins [5]. 2019-nCoV is one of the largest RNA virus genomes varying from 27kb to 32kb in size, with this particular strain ringing in at 29,903 bps long [6]. The virus is one of 7 coronaviruses known to infect humans, and along with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 2019-nCoV is one of the species responsible for severe respiratory distress in humans as well as other animals [4]. In an effort to better understand the pathogenesis of this family of viruses, several groups have sequenced individual strains, providing a powerful resource hosted by NCBI.",

The general layout of the Epigenome Browser displays the genome on the x-axis, and individual tracks encompassing many different varieties can be loaded and viewed in the context of the genome and accompanying metadata. Recent updates to the browser have incorporated new functionality, including live browsing, greatly enhancing its functionality [5]. With this powerful tool in-hand, we sought to adapt the browser for use of visualizing viral genomes, to support more efficient research and more rapid knowledge dissemination in response to the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak. To accomplish this, we created the WashU Virus Genome Browser, adapted from the WashU Epigenome Browser.",

Additionally, we aligned the genomes of all available strains in the database and generated a phylogenetic tree for each virus species that allows the user to directly select strains from the tree and view as tracks in the genomic display.

When users first navigate to the WashU Virus Browser and select \u201cBrowse Data\u201d, they are directed to a page with several customizable options, including a dropdown menu from which they may choose a reference genome [Figure 1]. Corresponding with the reference genome selected, a metadata table is displayed containing sortable features such as species, strain, isolate, isolation source, host, country, and collection date, to allow for quick and easy sorting of individual strains. The user may select viral isolates from the metadata table to be visualized in one of our two displayable platforms: the track view (green arrow, Figures 2 and 3) or the phylogenetic tree view (orange arrow, Figures 4 and 5).",

Upon zooming in, a genome comparison track can be used to inspect variations from the reference genome, particularly useful for comparing cross-species alignments and viewing structural variations [Figure 2B]. The genome comparison track is adopted from the Epigenome Browser. The top navy-colored horizontal bar represents the reference genome loaded (SARS in the case of Figure 2B) and the bottom purple-colored horizontal bar represents the sequence being aligned to the reference (the 2019-nCoV reference sequence, NC_045512.2, in this case).

We identified a list of 320 high-confidence linear epitopes [Supplementary Table 2] whose amino acids are identical to predicted translated products from the 2019-nCoV reference strain. These provide a catalogue of epitopes for researchers testing immune targets that can potentially elicit T-cell, B-cell and antibody response to 2019-nCoV.",
            "The second viewing option offered by the WashU Virus Genome Browser is a \u201ctree\u201d format, in which the evolutionary relationships of different viral isolates can be visualized as a phylogenetic tree [17]. When the user navigates to the data page of the browser, and selects \u201cTree View\u201d [Figure 1], all viral genomes hosted on the browser for the selected virus species are displayed in the form of a right-aligned phylogenetic tree, where solid lines indicate branch lengths [Figure 4]. To the right of the tree is a metadata heatmap displaying strain-specific details such as isolate, isolation source, host, country, and collection date. Additionally, if the user added any individual tracks to their cart from the main page, those selected will display a checkmark to the right, allowing the user to easily see where their strains of interest lie among all other strains.",

Along with the individual strains\u2019 SNV tracks, the epitope tracks can provide a quick, intuitive and visual resource to guide prioritization of experimental resources towards developing diagnostics and therapeutics against 2019-nCoV. The value of our novel SNV tracks will only increase as additional strains are sequenced, helping us better understand the evolving 2019-nCoV genome and prioritize epitopes.",
            "In addition to the right-aligned tree view, the browser also supports a more traditional leftaligned linear tree view and a radial view. The left-aligned tree view displays branch lengths indicating relatedness of isolates [Figure 5A]. We noticed that in each virus type, several individual strains maintained high sequence similarity, resulting in several short branch lengths and a long vertical tree. In order to improve visualization, we also created a radial tree view [Figure 5B]."
