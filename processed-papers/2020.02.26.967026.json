        "abstract": "The emergence and outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has rapidly become a global concern and has highlighted the need for fast, sensitive, and specific tools to surveil circulating viruses. Here we provide assay designs and experimental resources, for use with CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection, that could be valuable for ongoing surveillance. We provide assay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. Of our design set, we experimentally screened 4 SARS-CoV-2 designs with a CRISPR-Cas13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest-performing SARS-CoV-2 assay. We demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this assay using synthetic targets with fluorescent and lateral flow detection. Moreover, our provided protocol can be extended for testing the other 66 provided designs. Assay designs are available at https://adapt.sabetilab.org/.",

            "A novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (family: Coronaviridae), is the virus behind a severe outbreak originating in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is essential to slowing widespread transmission. In January 2020, we quickly made available a capture enrichment panel [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] using CATCH [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] that is aimed at enhancing sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Capture has also been important for ongoing SARS-like coronavirus surveillance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and the panel\u2019s inclusion of SARS-like bat and pangolin coronaviruses can aid surveillance efforts.<br/><br/>There are several challenges associated with surveillance during the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. First, high case counts overwhelm diagnostic testing capacity, underscoring the need for a rapid pipeline for sample processing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Second, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus subspecies and species, so detection assays can yield false positives if they are not exquisitely specific to SARS-CoV-2. Third, suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or have co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Therefore, it is important to characterize these other pathogens, for both patient diagnostics and outbreak response."

            "Designs for single assay and multiplex panels<br/><br/>We have been developing algorithms and machine learning models for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays, linked in a system called ADAPT (manuscript in preparation). The designs satisfy several constraints, including on:<br/><br/>\u25cf Comprehensiveness: Assays account for a high fraction of known sequence diversity in their species or subspecies (>97% for most assays), and are meant to be effective against variable targets.<br/><br/>\u25cf Predicted sensitivity: Assays are predicted by our machine learning model to have high detection activity against the full scope of targeted genomic diversity (here, based on LwaCas13a activity only).<br/><br/>\u25cf Predicted specificity: Assays have high predicted specificity to their species or subspecies, factoring in the full extent of known strain diversity, allowing them to be grouped into panels that are accurate in differentiating between related taxa.<br/><br/>Comprehensiveness and\u2014to some extent\u2014specificity of the designs can be verified in silico.<br/><br/>Using ADAPT we designed 67 assays, satisfying the above constraints, to identify: the SARS-related coronavirus species; SARS-CoV-2; two other subspecies in that species with high similarity to SARS-CoV-2; all other known Coronaviridae species, including 4 other species that commonly cause human illness; and other common respiratory viral species and subspecies (Table 1\u200b). Each assay targets a single species or subspecies and can be used individually (e.g., point-of-care detection); additionally, owing to how they are designed, multiple assays can be grouped together to test for multiple targets and distinguish them with high specificity.<br/><br/>Sequences for single assays and multiplex panels are available at https://adapt.sabetilab.org/."

        "discussion": [
            "Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing is key to developing and monitoring diagnostics and similar surveillance tools. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, genomes have been generated and shared at a remarkable pace, and we thank those who have contributed their data through GISAID [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. We and others, relying on this data [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], have shown that it is possible to rapidly design CRISPR-based tools for detection and surveillance during an outbreak. Among other goals for this work, we plan to evaluate: (1) sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 assay against clinical isolates and patient samples\u2014including sputum, throat, and nasal swabs\u2014some of which may be challenging sample types to test; (2) specificity at both the species and subspecies levels against highly related viruses. For the latter, we intend to use a mixture of synthetic targets reflecting different viral sequences, and patient samples or viral seedstocks when available. We hope that the comprehensiveness and high predicted sensitivity and specificity of our designs will enable many groups to proceed rapidly and successfully from assay testing through deployment."

            "The emergence and outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has rapidly become a global concern and has highlighted the need for fast, sensitive, and specific tools to surveil circulating viruses. Here we provide assay designs and experimental resources, for use with CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection, that could be valuable for ongoing surveillance. We provide assay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. Of our design set, we experimentally screened 4 SARS-CoV-2 designs with a CRISPR-Cas13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest-performing SARS-CoV-2 assay. We demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this assay using synthetic targets with fluorescent and lateral flow detection. Moreover, our provided protocol can be extended for testing the other 66 provided designs. Assay designs are available at https://adapt.sabetilab.org/."
        ],
        "Introduction": [
            "A novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (family: Coronaviridae), is the virus behind a severe outbreak originating in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is essential to slowing widespread transmission. In January 2020, we quickly made available a capture enrichment panel [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] using CATCH [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] that is aimed at enhancing sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Capture has also been important for ongoing SARS-like coronavirus surveillance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and the panel\u2019s inclusion of SARS-like bat and pangolin coronaviruses can aid surveillance efforts.",
            "There are several challenges associated with surveillance during the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. First, high case counts overwhelm diagnostic testing capacity, underscoring the need for a rapid pipeline for sample processing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Second, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus subspecies and species, so detection assays can yield false positives if they are not exquisitely specific to SARS-CoV-2. Third, suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or have co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Therefore, it is important to characterize these other pathogens, for both patient diagnostics and outbreak response.",
            "Here, we help address the challenge of identifying SARS-CoV-2 and the numerous other respiratory viral pathogens by reporting a set of comprehensive design options for 67 species and subspecies for CRISPR-based detection assays. We have not yet experimentally tested most of these designs, instead focusing our efforts so far on extensively testing a point-of-care assay for SARS-CoV-2 using the Cas13-based SHERLOCK technology [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Using this assay, we demonstrate sensitive detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 10 copies per microliter."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "We have been developing algorithms and machine learning models for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays, linked in a system called ADAPT (manuscript in preparation). The designs satisfy several constraints, including on:",
            "\u25cf Comprehensiveness: Assays account for a high fraction of known sequence diversity in their species or subspecies (>97% for most assays), and are meant to be effective against variable targets.",
            "\u25cf Predicted sensitivity: Assays are predicted by our machine learning model to have high detection activity against the full scope of targeted genomic diversity (here, based on LwaCas13a activity only).",
            "\u25cf Predicted specificity: Assays have high predicted specificity to their species or subspecies, factoring in the full extent of known strain diversity, allowing them to be grouped into panels that are accurate in differentiating between related taxa.",
            "Comprehensiveness and\u2014to some extent\u2014specificity of the designs can be verified in silico.",
            "Using ADAPT we designed 67 assays, satisfying the above constraints, to identify: the SARS-related coronavirus species; SARS-CoV-2; two other subspecies in that species with high similarity to SARS-CoV-2; all other known Coronaviridae species, including 4 other species that commonly cause human illness; and other common respiratory viral species and subspecies (Table 1\u200b). Each assay targets a single species or subspecies and can be used individually (e.g., point-of-care detection); additionally, owing to how they are designed, multiple assays can be grouped together to test for multiple targets and distinguish them with high specificity.",
            "Sequences for single assays and multiplex panels are available at https://adapt.sabetilab.org/.",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus(all known strain diversity)",
            "We initially screened a set of 4 designs for SHERLOCK [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] assays, output by ADAPT to detect SARS-CoV-2. We identified an assay, which was the best-performing and also our highest ranked design a priori. We extensively tested this assay using a synthetic RNA target and determined the limit of detection to be 10 copies/\u03bcl using both fluorescent and lateral flow detection (Figure 1\u200b). This assay performs well in comparison to the recently disclosed DETECTR [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] assay (sensitivity: 70\u2013300 cp/\u03bcl) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] and SHERLOCK assay (10\u2013100 cp/\u03bcl) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] for SARS-CoV-2. A protocol for performing this assay is provided in the Methods section and can be used for testing any of the other designs we have provided."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing is key to developing and monitoring diagnostics and similar surveillance tools. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, genomes have been generated and shared at a remarkable pace, and we thank those who have contributed their data through GISAID [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. We and others, relying on this data [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], have shown that it is possible to rapidly design CRISPR-based tools for detection and surveillance during an outbreak. Among other goals for this work, we plan to evaluate: (1) sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 assay against clinical isolates and patient samples\u2014including sputum, throat, and nasal swabs\u2014some of which may be challenging sample types to test; (2) specificity at both the species and subspecies levels against highly related viruses. For the latter, we intend to use a mixture of synthetic targets reflecting different viral sequences, and patient samples or viral seedstocks when available. We hope that the comprehensiveness and high predicted sensitivity and specificity of our designs will enable many groups to proceed rapidly and successfully from assay testing through deployment."
