        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nRapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control.\n\nMethods\nThe Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. \n\nFindings\nCases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. \n\nInterpretation\nOur data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.",

Each case was recorded into the system by local epidemiologists and public health professionals who did the field investigation and collected possible exposure related information. All data on COVID-19 case reported in Shenzhen were extracted from the Infectious Disease Information System by the end of February 12, 2020. Then personal information including demographics, symptoms, clinical outcome and severity and so on, were stripped to construct an anonymous dataset. All cases were included without sampling and no eligibility criteria were needed. All laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 were done by Guangdong Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) before Jan 30, 2020, and then only need to be done by Shenzhen CDC, when it obtained the qualification of laboratory-confirmation of 2019-nCoV from the authority. The RT-PCR assay was conducted in the BSL-3 laboratory of Shenzhen CDC, using the protocol established by the World Health Organization and China CDC"

In particular, we are able to make assumptions about when and where cases were likely infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing critical information on transmission and natural history.

            "This analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 cases and their close contacts in Shenzhen China, provides insights into the natural history, transmission and control of this disease. The values estimated provide the evidentiary foundation for predicting the impact of this virus, evaluating control measures, and guiding the global response. Analysis of how cases are detected, and use of data on individuals exposed but not infected, allow us to show that infection rates in young children are no lower than the population average (even if rates of clinical disease are). We are able to directly estimate critical transmission parameters, and show that, at least among observed contacts, transmission rates are low. Estimates of the distribution of time between symptom onset and case isolation by surveillance type reveal that heightened surveillance combined with case isolation could plausibly account for these low rates of transmission. These results paint a positive picture of the impact of heightened surveillance and isolation in Shenzhen. However, uncertainty in the number of asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance and their ability to transmit must temper any hopes of stopping the COVID-19 epidemic by this means."

There was a general trend of increasing probability of severe symptoms with age, though only [60-69] year olds showed a significant difference from the reference category (OR 3.4 versus [50-59] year olds; 95% 1.4,9.5) and being male (OR=2.5, 95%CI 1.1, 6.1) (Table 2).",
            "Based on 183 cases with a well defined period of exposure and symptom onset (Figure S1), we estimate the median incubation period for COVID-19 to be 4.8 days (95% CI 4.2,5.4) [Figure 2, Table S2], and that 95% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 14.0 days (95% CI 12.2,15.9) of infection.",

In multiple regression models including sex, age, baseline severity and method of detection, in addition to age, baseline severity was associated with time to recovery. Compared to those with mild symptoms, those with moderate symptoms were associated with a 19% (95% CI, 17%,22%) increase in time to recovery, and severe symptoms were associated with a 58% (95% CI, 55%, 61%) increase. Thus far, only three have died. These occurred [35-44] days from symptom onset and [27-33] days from confirmation.",

Among those isolated after, the symptom-based surveillance group were, on average, isolated 4.6 days (95% CI 4.1,5.0) after symptom onset, versus 2.7 days (95% CI 2.1,3.3) in the contact-based surveillance group. Hence, contact-based surveillance was associated with a 2.3 days (95% CI 1.5,3.0) decrease in time to confirmation and a 1.9 days (95% CI 1.1,2.7) decrease in time to isolation. Timings between symptom onset and hospitalization were similar to isolation results (Figure 3, Table S2).",

Those developing symptoms prior to arrival or on the day of arrival were confirmed as cases on average 4.5 days (95% CI 3.8,5.1) after arrival, and isolated on average 3.1 days (95% CI, 2.5,3.7) after.",
            "Overall, 1286 close contacts were identified for index cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between January 14 and February 9, 2020, with 83% (244/292) of cases having at least one close contact. Ninety-five percent of close contacts were followed 12 days or longer. Ninety-eight tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and one had presumptive infection. Excluding those with a missing test result, we found that the secondary attack rate was 14.9% (95% CI 12.1,18.2) among household contacts and 9.6% (95%CI 7.9,11.8) overall (these drop to 11.2% and 6.6% if those with missing results are considered to be negative). In multivariable analysis of contact types household contact (OR 6.3, 95% CI 1.5, 26.3) and travelling together (OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.4, 34.9) were significantly associated with infection.

Notably, the rate of infection in children under 10 (7.4%) was similar to the population average (7.9%). There was no significant association between probability of infection and age of the index case. Surprisingly, in univariate analysis a longer time in the community prior to isolation was associated with a reduced risk of causing infections. However, this association was no longer significant after adjusting for contact frequency and type.",
            "Based on 48 pairs of cases with a clear infector-infectee relationship and time of symptom onset, we estimate that the serial interval is gamma distributed with mean 6.3 days (95% CI 5.2,7.6) and a standard deviation of 4.2 days (95% CI, 3.1,5.3) (Figure 2B, Table S2). Hence, 95% of cases are expected to develop symptoms within 14.3 (95% CI, 11.1,17.6) days of their infector. It should be noted this estimate includes the effect of isolation on truncating the serial interval. Stratified results show that if the infector was isolated less than 3 days after infection the average serial interval was 3.6 days, increasing to 8.1 days if the infector was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later (Table S4).",
            "The mean number of secondary cases caused by each index case (i.e., the observed reproductive number, R), was 0.4 (95% CI 0.3,0.5). The distribution of personal reproductive numbers was highly overdispersed, with 80% of infections being caused by 8.9% (95% CI 3.5,10.8) of cases (negative binomial dispersion parameter 0.58, 95% CI 0.35, 1.18).",
            "To calculate the potential impact of surveillance and isolation on transmission, we considered a range of possible infectious periods where infectiousness varied over time. We define the mean infectious day (i.e., the average number of days after symptom onset an infector is expected to infect a secondary case) as the weighted mean of the infectious period, where each day is weighted by relative infectiousness. We consider periods where the mean infectious day is less than 15 days after symptom onset (roughly the period of SARS and early SARS-CoV-2 reports 16,17), and assume that R= 2.6 and that isolation effectively ends the infectious period. Under these assumptions we find if the mean infectious day is greater than 5 days, then it may be possible to bring R below one in those detected by symptom-based surveillance; and the same can be accomplished by contact-based surveillance if the mean infectious day is greater than 3 days. For the impact of passive surveillance alone to achieve our observed Rof 0.4, we project the mean infectious day must be at least 5.5 days (and likely more) after symptom onset.",
            "Even if transmission is completely eliminated in the group captured by surveillance (e.g., if we could get perfect surveillance on the day of symptom onset), assuming R=\u200b2.6, the cases captured by surveillance must, if unisolated, be expected to cause 61% of onward transmission to achieve local elimination by surveillance and isolation alone (see Text S2)."

        "Discussion": [
            "This analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 cases and their close contacts in Shenzhen China, provides insights into the natural history, transmission and control of this disease. The values estimated provide the evidentiary foundation for predicting the impact of this virus, evaluating control measures, and guiding the global response. Analysis of how cases are detected, and use of data on individuals exposed but not infected, allow us to show that infection rates in young children are no lower than the population average (even if rates of clinical disease are). We are able to directly estimate critical transmission parameters, and show that, at least among observed contacts, transmission rates are low. Estimates of the distribution of time between symptom onset and case isolation by surveillance type reveal that heightened surveillance combined with case isolation could plausibly account for these low rates of transmission. These results paint a positive picture of the impact of heightened surveillance and isolation in Shenzhen. However, uncertainty in the number of asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance and their ability to transmit must temper any hopes of stopping the COVID-19 epidemic by this means.",
            "This work further supports the picture of COVID-19 as a disease with a fairly short incubation period (mean [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] days) but a long clinical course 2\u200b ,7,19,with patients taking many weeks to die or recover. It should be noted, however, that we estimate a higher proportion of cases taking 14 days or more to develop symptoms (9%) than previous studies 6\u200b ,7.",
            "Focusing on cases detected through contact-based surveillance adds nuance to previous characterizations of COVID-19. Since PCR testing of contacts is near universal, we can assume these cases are more reflective of the average SARS-CoV-2 infection than cases detected through symptomatic surveillance. In the contact-based surveillance group, any tendency for cases to be male or older (beyond the underlying population distribution, see Table S3) disappears. Further, in this group, 20% were asymptomatic at the time of first clinical assessment and nearly 30% did not have fever. This is consistent with a reasonably high rate of asymptomatic carriage, but less than suggested by some modeling studies1\u200b 8,though PCR has imperfect sensitivity2\u200b 0.",
            "In Shenzhen, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is most likely between very close contacts, such as individuals sharing a household. However, even in this group less than 1 in 6 contacts were infected; and, overall, we observed far less than one (0.4) onward transmission per primary case. As noted above, low transmission levels may in part be due to the impact of isolation and surveillance; but it is equally likely unobserved transmission is playing some rule. We also estimate reasonably high rates of overdispersion in the number of cases each individual causes, leaving open the possibility that large COVID-19 clusters occur even if surveillance and isolation are forcing Rbelow one; events that could potentially overwhelm the surveillance system.",
            "This work has numerous limitations. As in any active outbreak response, the data were collected by multiple teams under protocols that, by necessity, changed as the situation developed. Hence, there may be noise and inconsistency in definitions. Of note, the definition of a confirmed case changed to require symptoms near the end of our analysis period (Feb. 7); but sensitivity analyses show that truncating the data at this point does not qualitatively impact results. It is, likewise, impossible to identify every potential contact an individual has, so contact tracing focuses on those close contacts most likely to be infected; hence our observed Ris assuredly less than the true Rin the population. Asymptomatic travellers will be missed by symptom-based surveillance; and, even if tested, some asymptomatic contacts may be missed due to the imperfect sensitivity of the PCR test 2\u200b 0.",
            "As SARS-CoV-19 continues to spread, it is important that we continue to expand our knowledge about its transmission and natural history. Data from the early phase of local outbreaks, when detailed contact tracing is possible and sources of infection can still be reliably inferred, are particularly powerful for estimating critical values. This is especially true when information on uninfected contacts and mode of detection are used, as we have done here. The resulting estimates provide critical inputs for interpreting surveillance data, evaluating interventions, and setting public health policy."

            "Since emerging in Wuhan, China in December of 20191\u200b ,the epidemic of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has progressed rapidly.",
            "Early introductions of an emerging pathogen provide a unique opportunity to characterize its transmission, natural history, and the effectiveness of screening.",
            "The authors are able to make assumptions about when and where cases were likely infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread",
            "During these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing critical information on transmission and natural history.",
            "The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control"
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts.",
            "The authors compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization.",
            "Case Identification On January 8, 2020, Shenzhen CDC identified the first case of pneumonia with unknown cause and began monitoring travelers from Hubei province for symptoms of COVID-19.",
            "Close contacts and travelers from Hubei testing negative were isolated at home or a central facility, and monitored for 14 days.",
            "Signs and symptoms, clinical severity, and exposure history were recorded for all confirmed cases"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics<br/><br/>Between Jan 14, 2020 and Feb 12, 2020 the Shenzhen CDC confirmed 391 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1).",
            "Of 379 with a known mode of detection, 77% were detected through symptom-based surveillance.",
            "At the time of first clinical assessment, most cases were mild (26%) or moderate (65%); and only 35 (9%) were severe.",
            "Eighty-four percent of cases had fever at the time of initial assessment, while.",
            "As of February 22, 2020, final clinical outcomes were known for 228 of the 391 cases in the data; with three having died and 225 recovered"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "This analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 cases and their close contacts in Shenzhen China, provides insights into the natural history, transmission and control of this disease.",
            "Estimates of the distribution of time between symptom onset and case isolation by surveillance type reveal that heightened surveillance combined with case isolation could plausibly account for these low rates of transmission.",
            "These results paint a positive picture of the impact of heightened surveillance and isolation in Shenzhen.",
            "Uncertainty in the number of asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance and their ability to transmit must temper any hopes of stopping the COVID-19 epidemic by this means"
