The median age was 58 years (IQR, 49-72 years). The median time from first symptoms to respiratory distress was 10 d (IQR, 7-13 days). All patients had fever, and the highest fever was 40\u00b0C, and the median fever temperature was 38.5\u00b0C (IQR, 38-39.6\u00b0C). Four (36.4%) patients had muscle soreness in the early stage of fever, and 9 (81.8%) had dry cough in the early stage. All patients had symptoms of hypoxia when they were admitted to ICU. Among them, 5(45.5%)patients had a history of Cardio-cerebrovascular disease, and 4(36.4%) patients had a history of diabetes (type II diabetes). All the patients had symptoms of low oxygen saturation and metabolic acidosis (Table 1). After entering the ICU, all the patients had at least one or more organ dysfunction or even failure manifestations. These included 9 patients with cardiac dysfunction, 8 with renal dysfunction, 6 with liver dysfunction and coagulation dysfunction, 5 with coagulant function abnormality, and 4 with multi-organ failure syndrome. 10 patients were treated with steroids and all patients had antiviral and anti-infective therapy (Table 2 and Table 3)."

            "This is a single-center retrospective study of 11 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU with persistent fever and ARDS. In addition to routine laboratory tests in the ICU, the number of immune cell subsets and cytokine levels in peripheral blood were analyzed in all patients. After analysis of the detection results, clinical characteristics, and diagnosis of all patients, we identified eight (72.7%) COVID-19-infected critical type pneumonia patients that had the clinical characteristics of CRSL. Lung injury has a potential risk of CRS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Cytokine release is common in immunotherapy, especially in cellular immunotherapy. The reasons for the occurrence of CRS are unclear. The main mechanism is that inflammatory cells, such as effector T cells and macrophages, accumulate rapidly from peripheral blood by chemokines and release a large number of cytokines into the blood when they kill tumor cells, viruses, or bacteria[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The disease is characterized by a marked increase in characteristic cytokines (such as IL-6), persistent fever, and organ and tissue damage[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The rapid chain reaction caused by cytokine release syndrome usually causes rapid organ immune related injury and acute functional failure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. We analyzed the clinical and immunological characteristics of 11 COVID-19-infected patients with severe pneumonia. We found that: Patients with severe pneumonia have different degrees of fever; peripheral blood CD4, CD8, NK, and other immune T cells decreased; CD4 / CD8 significantly increased, IL-6 significantly increased; multiple organ injuries were present; and coagulation dysfunction occurred. The concentration of IL-6 and the number of CD4, CD8, NK immune cells in the peripheral blood can be significantly reduced by improving ventilation, lowering body temperature, using anti-inflammatory treatment and other supportive treatment. The function of organs and tissues will be improved, which shows the importance of cytokines. COVID-19-infected patients with severe pneumonia have symptoms and manifestations similar to CRS. Therefore, we define this phenomenon as COVID-19 infection-related CRSL with the characteristics include: 1 decrease of circulating blood CD4, CD8 T cells and NK cells; 2 substantial increase of IL-6 cytokine in peripheral blood ; 3 continuous fever; 4 organ and tissue damage caused by the cytokine related immune reaction, and the coagulation dysfunction. We also found that 8 of 11 (72.7%) critically ill patients in our study had characteristics consistent with cytokine-like release syndrome. The concentration of IL-6 and the number of CD4, CD8 and NK immune cells in the peripheral blood can be reduced by improving ventilation, lowering body temperature, anti-inflammatory treatment, and other supportive treatment after ICU. The function of organs and tissues will be improved, which shows the dependence of cytokines. COVID-19-infected patients with severe pneumonia have evidence and manifestations similar to CRS. Large-scale lung injury caused by viral pneumonia is the inducing factor of COVID-19-infected CRS. Because large-scale lung injury is a typical feature of critical patients, COVID-19-infected CRS may be a common phenomenon in critically ill patients. We found that a large area of lung injury (\u226550%) with an decrease of CD4, CD8 (Lower than 50% minimum normal range) and increase of IL-6 in peripheral blood was the highest risk factor of CRSL. After the COVID-19-infected pneumonia in the critically ill patients, the change of IL-6 levels were one or two days earlier than the absolution number of CD4 and"

        "conclusions": [
            "We identified and defined the CRSL in 11 critically ill patients with COVID-19-infected pneumonia.

            "Guangzhou Medical University in China from January 26, 2020 to February 18, 2020. The follow-up termination date was February 19, 2020. EXPOSERES: Eleven COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients with ARDS in the ICU. Some of these patients also had cytokine release syndrome-like (CRSL). Immunologic detection, clinical characteristics, and clinical treatment analysis were carried out to define the CRSL in these COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical, radiological, immunology (including immune cell subsets and cytokines analysis), laboratory, and clinical treatment data were collected and analyzed. The critically ill patients with CRSL were defined. Prevention and control strategies were studied. RESULTS: Of 11 critically ill patients in the ICU, the median age was 58 (Inter-Quartile Range{IQR}, 49\u201372; range, 26\u201372 years), and 10 (83.3%) were males. Ten (83.3%) patients had extensive pulmonary inflammation and ARDS (the median time from the first symptom to ARDS was 10.0 d), fever, and hypoxia; four (28.6%) patients experienced shock. The lymphocyte subpopulations including CD3 (CD3 + CD45+), CD4 (CD3 + CD4+), CD8 (CD3 + CD8+), NK (CD3-CD16 + CD56 +), Tregs (CD4 + CD25 + CD127 low), B lymphocyte (CD3-CD19 +) cells; and cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 were detected at different time points. All of the patients had a decrease of CD3 (IQR,169\u2013335; range, 50\u2013635 cells/\u03bcL), CD4 (IQR,101\u2013303; range, 27\u2013350 cells/\u03bcL), CD8 (IQR, 33\u2013141; range, 21\u2013277",

And nine patients were increase in CD4 / CD8 (IQR,3.3\u20137.8%; range, 2.3\u20139.7%). All patients had a significant increase of IL-6 (IQR,14.26-92.2; range, 4.58\u20131182.91ng/L). Eight (72.7%) patients were determined to have CRSL characteristics, including pulmonary inflammation, fever, a decrease of CD4, CD8, and NK cells; an increase of CD4/CD8, a significant increase of IL-6, and the dysfunction of non-pulmonary organs. The numbers of CD4, CD8, and NK cells and the level of IL-6 in peripheral blood were correlated with the area of pulmonary inflammation in CT images (P<0.05). Mechanical-ventilation used to increase blood oxygen concentration could increased the numbers of CD4 (after Vs before ventilation=259\u00b153 VS 507\u00b1101; P=0.013, and CD8 (after Vs before ventilation=193\u00b138 VS 279\u00b163; P=0.048), while decreasing the level of IL-6 (after Vs before ventilation=223.2\u00b1 89.9 VS 26.8\u00b110; P=0.041). The increased of IL-6 was occurred earlier than the decrease of CD4\u00b7, CD8 in the patients with rapidly worsened after ICU. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this retrospective analysis of 11 critically ill pneumonia patients infected with COVID-19, we defined and identified eight patients (72.7%) with cytokine release syndrome-like (CRSL). We found that a large area of lung injury (\u226550%) with an decrease of CD4, CD8 (Lower than 50% minimum normal range) and increase of IL-6 in peripheral blood was the highest risk factor of CRSL. IL-6 was a early indicators of CRSL in COVID-19-infected pneumonia. We also found that reduce injury to the lung is a useful method to prevent and improve COVID-19-infected pneumonia-related CRSL in critically ill pneumonia patients.",
            "In December 2019, a Novel Coronavirus which was named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The disease spread rapidly to all provinces of China outside of Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. By February 17, 2020, there were 70,636 confirmed cases and 1,772 deaths in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Some of the COVID-19-infected critically ill pneumonia patients had serious symptoms with no specific drug treatment indicated. Severe inflammatory reaction and respiratory distress syndrome can lead to rapid progression of the disease and cause death. A guideline \u201cDiagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial version fifth)\u201d was first published on February 3 in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. It suggested that immune factors were needed to examine in the therapy of COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients. The release of inflammatory immune cytokines could increase the inflammatory of the lung and risk the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS could lead to hypoxia and lung injury, causing the release of inflammatory factors by multiple mechanisms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. So, an excess release of inflammatory factors may promote ARDS in COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients. Critically ill COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients suffer from fever, pulmonary inflammation, respiratory distress, and other clinical symptoms. In published data, the proportion of ICU patients is 26.1% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. The average age of patients in the ICU is higher than that in non-ICU patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. In addition, the incidence of acute heart injury and respiratory distress in ICU patients is much higher than that in the general population[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Serious pulmonary inflammation is a common symptom in critically ill COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. The large area of infection and inflammatory reaction will cause many immunologic problems, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can rapidly lead to deterioration and death[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In this study, after analysis of the clinical diagnosis and immunological characteristics of 11 COVID-19-infected patients with ARDS, we diagnosed eight (8/11, 72.7%) critically ill COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients to have cytokine release syndrome-like (CRSL) features. Therefore, we defined this phenomenon as COVID-19 infection-related CRSL. Our results found that IL-6 was a early indicators of CRSL in COVID-19-infected pneumonia, and suggestion that improving ventilation and controlling the area of pulmonary inflammation may be an effective method to treat the COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients with CRSL and ARDS. Our research provides experimental support and experiences useful for the treatment of critically ill COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients."

            "This is a single-center retrospective study of 11 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU with persistent fever and ARDS. In addition to routine laboratory tests in the ICU, the number of immune cell subsets and cytokine levels in peripheral blood were analyzed in all patients. After analysis of the detection results, clinical characteristics, and diagnosis of all patients, we identified eight (72.7%) COVID-19-infected critical type pneumonia patients that had the clinical characteristics of CRSL. Lung injury has a potential risk of CRS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Cytokine release is common in immunotherapy, especially in cellular immunotherapy. The reasons for the occurrence of CRS are unclear. The main mechanism is that inflammatory cells, such as effector T cells and macrophages, accumulate rapidly from peripheral blood by chemokines and release a large number of cytokines into the blood when they kill tumor cells, viruses, or bacteria[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The disease is characterized by a marked increase in characteristic cytokines (such as IL-6), persistent fever, and organ and tissue damage[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The rapid chain reaction caused by cytokine release syndrome usually causes rapid organ immune related injury and acute functional failure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. We analyzed the clinical and immunological characteristics of 11 COVID-19-infected patients with severe pneumonia. We found that: Patients with severe pneumonia have different degrees of fever; peripheral blood CD4, CD8, NK, and other immune T cells decreased; CD4 / CD8 significantly increased, IL-6 significantly increased; multiple organ injuries were present; and coagulation dysfunction occurred. The concentration of IL-6 and the number of CD4, CD8, NK immune cells in the peripheral blood can be significantly reduced by improving ventilation, lowering body temperature, using anti-inflammatory treatment and other supportive treatment. The function of organs and tissues will be improved, which shows the importance of cytokines. COVID-19-infected patients with severe pneumonia have symptoms and manifestations similar to CRS. Therefore, we define this phenomenon as COVID-19 infection-related CRSL with the characteristics include: 1 decrease of circulating blood CD4, CD8 T cells and NK cells; 2 substantial increase of IL-6 cytokine in peripheral blood ; 3 continuous fever; 4 organ and tissue damage caused by the cytokine related immune reaction, and the coagulation dysfunction. We also found that 8 of 11 (72.7%) critically ill patients in our study had characteristics consistent with cytokine-like release syndrome. The concentration of IL-6 and the number of CD4, CD8 and NK immune cells in the peripheral blood can be reduced by improving ventilation, lowering body temperature, anti-inflammatory treatment, and other supportive treatment after ICU. The function of organs and tissues will be improved, which shows the dependence of cytokines. COVID-19-infected patients with severe pneumonia have evidence and manifestations similar to CRS. Large-scale lung injury caused by viral pneumonia is the inducing factor of COVID-19-infected CRS. Because large-scale lung injury is a typical feature of critical patients, COVID-19-infected CRS may be a common phenomenon in critically ill patients. We found that a large area of lung injury (\u226550%) with an decrease of CD4, CD8 (Lower than 50% minimum normal range) and increase of IL-6 in peripheral blood was the highest risk factor of CRSL. After the COVID-19-infected pneumonia in the critically ill patients, the change of IL-6 levels were one or two days earlier than the absolution number of CD4 and",
            "CD8 decreased in peripheral blood. This indicated IL-6 may works as an early indicator of CRSL in COVID-19-infected pneumonia. This study has several limitations. First, we only studied 11 critical patients in a single center and we were unable to conduct a group comparison study. Additional data from critical patients in China would be useful. Second, due to the strong infectivity of the virus, we were not able to construct a COVID-19-infected pneumonia animal model. A validated model could help clarify the molecular mechanism of CRS caused by viral pneumonia. Third, we have not finished the clinical experiment on the treatment of COVID-19-infected pneumonia with IL-6 monoclonal antibody."

        "Conclusions": [
            "We identified and defined the CRSL in 11 critically ill patients with COVID-19-infected pneumonia. We found that a large area of lung injury by COVID-19-infected was often accompanied by the increase of IL-6 and decrease of CD4, CD8 and NK immune T cells in peripheral blood and was the risk factor of CRS. IL-6 was an early indicator of CRSL in COVID-19-infected pneumonia. We also found that reduce injury to the lung is a useful method to prevent and improve COVID-19-infected pneumonia-related CRSL in critically ill pneumonia patients.",
