        "abstract": "Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations.  We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.",

The new virus is different from known coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, though they share some similar respiratory illness symptoms such as fever, cough, or/and shortness of breath [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. It is believed to root from the animal but spreads from person-to-person. The COVID-19 spread even shows that persons without any symptoms or clinically negative in infection can still spread it to others. There is no official vaccine or antiviral drug available up to now (Jan 30, 2020) to treat COVID-19 infected patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection is forcing China and many countries to take harsh protection policies. More than eight-thousands of infections have been reported in China and more than a dozen of countries until Jan 30, 2020. More than 15 cities including Wuhan have been quarantined to halt the spread of the COVID-19. It is expected that millions of people can be on lockdown because of COVID-19. WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Jan 30, 2020."

            "We estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 in this study and analyze its properties by employing statistical and machine learning techniques. We estimate that the mean and median of COVID-19 as 5.84 and 5.01 days by employing nonparametric techniques. The proposed Monte Carlo simulation method echo the nonparametric estimation results. The incubation median of COVID-19: 5.01days (95% CI (4.0, 6.0) days is close to that of SARS (4.6 days) (95%CI: (3.8,5.8)). Compared to the incubation mean of MERS: 5.5 days (95% CI: (3.6-10.2) days), the COVID-19 mean incubation period: 5.84 days (95% CI: (5.07, 6.45)) are also slightly longer [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. It suggests that COVID-19 could have a faster distribution speed than H7N9, but the same spread speed as SARS and MERS in terms of their incubation periods [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. The existing spread of COVID-19 is faster than SARS partially because it has more complicate spread dynamics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. For example, those without clinical symptoms can still spread the virus even if they are \u2018officially negative\u2019 in the COVID-19 virus test [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]."

            "Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chainof-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions."

        "Methods": [
            "We collected a dataset with 59 officially confirmed COVID-19 cases from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province, the assumed origin of the virus. The patient data was dated from Dec 29, 2019, to Feb 5, 2020. We only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset in data collection. We exclude those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time.",

Although we can\u2019t reject Gamma distributions for its boundary line p-value (0.06086), it can be risky to use it to fit and estimate the distribution of the incubation period under a small sample size. We further employ the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for the parameters of the gamma, conduct the goodness-fit test, and obtain p-value=8.6807e-04.

            "Novel coronaviruses (COVID-19), which was found in Wuhan, China in December 2019 presents an acute public health threat to the whole world [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The new virus is different from known coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, though they share some similar respiratory illness symptoms such as fever, cough, or/and shortness of breath [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. It is believed to root from the animal but spreads from person-to-person. The COVID-19 spread even shows that persons without any symptoms or clinically negative in infection can still spread it to others. There is no official vaccine or antiviral drug available up to now (Jan 30, 2020) to treat COVID-19 infected patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection is forcing China and many countries to take harsh protection policies. More than eight-thousands of infections have been reported in China and more than a dozen of countries until Jan 30, 2020. More than 15 cities including Wuhan have been quarantined to halt the spread of the COVID-19. It is expected that millions of people can be on lockdown because of COVID-19. WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Jan 30, 2020.",
            "It is essential to know the accurate incubation period of COVID-19 for the sake of deciphering dynamics of its spread. The incubation period is the time from infection to the onset of the disease. It provides the foundation for epidemiological prevention, clinical actions, and drug discovery. Different viruses have different incubation periods that determine their different dynamics epidemiologically. The incubation period of H7N9 (Human Avian Influenza A) is about 6.5 days, but the incubation period for SARS-CoV is typically 2 to 7 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period of COVID-19, although WHO estimates it is between 2 to 14 days after exposure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. It can be difficult to estimate the",
            "incubation period of COVID-19 by using original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. Or data may lack meaningful exposure history. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether the incubation time will show some statistically significant with respect to Age and Gender. In this study, we aim to accurately estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of datasets with a well-documented history of exposure. Our results show the incubation mean and median of COVID-19 are 5.84 and 5.0 days respectively and there is a statistical significance with the role of gender. However, the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years show a statistically significant difference. Our machine learning analysis also shows that the two groups are linearly separable that demonstrate a clear boundary in knowledge discovery visualization."

The incubation median of COVID-19: 5.01days (95% CI (4.0, 6.0) days is close to that of SARS (4.6 days) (95%CI: (3.8,5.8)). Compared to the incubation mean of MERS: 5.5 days (95% CI: (3.6-10.2) days), the COVID-19 mean incubation period: 5.84 days (95% CI: (5.07, 6.45)) are also slightly longer [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. It suggests that COVID-19 could have a faster distribution speed than H7N9, but the same spread speed as SARS and MERS in terms of their incubation periods [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. The existing spread of COVID-19 is faster than SARS partially because it has more complicate spread dynamics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

            "We also investigate the incubation period of 12 family cases and 47 non-family cases in the dataset. The family cases simply refer to the patients who were caught by COVID-19 because their family members had been infected. The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there are not significant differences between family patients and non-family patients in terms of the median of incubation period. The Siegal-Tukey tests on scale also verify that the incubation scales are at the same level for family patients and non-family patients.",
            "Our studies indicate that incubation periods of the age>=40 years and age<40 years groups not only statistically significant but also linearly separable in machine learning. It may suggest different treatments should be considered for the two different groups. It will be more interesting to estimate different incubation time for them separately. That the estimated 97.5th percentile of COVID-19 incubation is 12.89 days (95% CI: (11.00, 16.13)) may suggest a long isolation or quarantine time (e.g. 17 days) can be better than the widely accepted 14 days. Furthermore, different quarantine time should be applied to the age>=40 years and age<40 years groups for their different incubation periods. Generally speaking, a longer quarantine time can be considered for the old patients (>=40 years) than young patients (<40 years old). Our ongoing work is to collect more qualified data to extend our existing results and investigate incubation of COVID-19 for different groups besides comparing our incubation estimation with other studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]."
