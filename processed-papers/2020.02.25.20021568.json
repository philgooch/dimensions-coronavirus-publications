        "DISCUSSION": [
            "As of Feb 14, 2020, the national health commission had reported 66,492 confirmed cases, 1,523 deaths and 8,969 suspected cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] In the face of such large number of patients and high contagiosity of the novel coronavirus (with an estimated reproduction number R0 of 2.2~6.47), timely diagnosis and isolation are the keys to prevent further spread of the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] CT scan is the most efficient modality for screening and clinically diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]",
            "However, compared to the needs of the patients, the number of radiologists is quite small, especially in Hubei province, China, which could greatly delay the diagnosis and isolation of patients, affect patient\u2019s treatment and prognosis, and ultimately, affect the overall control of",
            "COVID-19 epidemic.",
            "Deep learning, a technology has shown great performance on extracting tiny features in radiology data, may hold the promise to alleviate this problem.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Recently, Ardila D, et al achieved end-to-end lung cancer screening on low-dose chest CT with an AUC of 94.4%.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]",
            "Chae KJ, et al successfully used the convolutional neural network to classify small (\u22642 cm) pulmonary nodules on CT scan images.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] However, there was rare research being conducted to detect viral pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] In previous work, our group succeeded in recruiting deep learning in minor lesion detection and real-time assistance to doctors in gastrointestinal endoscopy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] Here, we enrolled this technique in identification of COVID-19 pneumonia in",
            "CT images. Results from both retrospective and prospective patients showed that the model was comparable to the level of expert radiologist, and hold great potential to reduce diagnosing time.",
            "Early diagnosis and early isolation of suspected patients are the most important ways to prevent the spread of epidemic.19 Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID19, the radiology department is overloaded and patients have to wait for long times for chest CT scan, which largely increase the risk of cross-infection. In recent days, radiologists\u2019 daily workload is huge in Hubei province, and a CT scan report has to be awaited several hours to achieve. Based on the number of suspected patients and close contacts in being, radiologists in the hardest hit, Hubei province, China, may not be enough to resist the rapid spread of the virus, which holds high estimated R0 of",
            "2.2~6.47.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] It could be inferred that before radiologists fulfilling the demands of existing patients, newly infected cases would appear, and the overall burden of radiologists is more overwhelming like a growing snowball. Relieving the pressure of radiologists is essential for the control of virus spreading. In the present study, our model achieved a comparable performance but with much shorter time compared with expert radiologists. It holds great potential to relieve the pressure of radiologists in clinical practice, and contribute to the control of the epidemic.",

            "In the present study, our model helped expert radiologists achieve the same work with much shorter time, which greatly accelerats the efficiency of diagnosis in clinical practice, and may contribute to the improvement of patient outcome.",
            "In addition to relieving radiologists\u2019 pressure and accelerating diagnosis efficiency, artificial intelligence also holds the potential to reduce miss diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The lung infection foci are sometimes mild in the early stage of the COVID-19 infection,5 and requires careful observation under 0.625mm layer scanning. Radiologists vary in skills, and could be affected by subjective status and outside pressure. One miss diagnosis could lead to multiple spread. The model is highly sensitive and stable, and would never be affected by work burden and work time. As a preliminary screening tool, it might help radiologists improve the sensitivity and reduce miss diagnosis.",
            "On the basis of the accuracy and efficiency of the model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia, a cloud-based open-access artificial intelligence platform was constructed to provide assistance for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide. CT scan images could be uploaded freely by both clinicians and researches as an assistant tool, especially in other provinces or countries unfamiliar with the radiologic characteristics of COVID-19. This free open-access website can read images in batches, provide high-level auxiliary diagnostic services for different hospitals in free, and expand the boundaries of regions and manpower. Cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were also been made available on the open-access website, which might be a useful resource for radiologists and researchers for fighting COVID-19 pneumonia.",
            "In summary, the deep learning-based model achieved a comparable performance with expert radiologist using much shorter time.
