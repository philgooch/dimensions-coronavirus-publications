        "abstract": "Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting, in particular, the severe under-reporting bias in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.",

            "Similarly, Fig. 2B presents the same relationship for 14 cities within Hubei Province. These cities had received at least 100,000 travelers from Wuhan. From Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B, we observe a statistically significant positive linear relationship between the number of travelers from Wuhan and the cumulative case count in most provinces and cities. For two provinces, Zhejiang and Jiangsu (in Fig. 2A), and two Hubei cities, Xiaogan and Huanggang (in Fig. 2B), we observe superlinear growth in the cumulative case counts, explainable by the known significant secondary local transmissions. Fig. 2C presents zone-level aggregated results.",
            "Under our proposed geo-stratified debiasing framework, the latent infection ratio among the people traveling from Wuhan to other destinations in mainland China excluding Hubei within a three-week window prior to the lockdown, is estimated as 0.12% (95% CI: 0.09%-0.15%). Based on this latent infection ratio, we inferred that there were in total 18,556 (95% CI: 14,13422,978) L&I persons in Wuhan before the lockdown, under the assumption that this latent infection ratio remained the same for people traveling from and remaining in Wuhan. Among these L&I persons, 10,887 (95% CI: 8,292-13,481) stayed in Wuhan on January 23, 2020, when the lockdown was initiated, and the remaining 7,669 (95% CI: 5,842-9,497) traveled to other parts of mainland China. Among the traveling L&I persons, 4,644-7,549 went to other places in Hubei Province, and 1,198 to 1,947 to places outside Hubei."

The recent quarantine lockdown of Wenzhou was in response to detection of large numbers of secondary transmissions.",
            "It is absolute key for being able to prevent this epidemic from becoming a pandemic that cases of clinical disease are detected and isolated as early as possible. In addition, all high-risk contacts need to be traced to identify secondary transmissions. The public health surveillance system in China is facing tremendous challenge give the population size and sensitivity of the system is to be enhanced. It is therefore paramount that available resources are used optimally. An understanding of the spatial distribution of the L&I persons is critical in this context, since they are the reservoir of clinical cases and of secondary transmission, although to a lesser extent than clinical cases. The annual migration around the Lunar New Year compounded the situation in that it immensely increased movements across the country. The human movement data utilized in this study provides a robust data source for estimating the likely dissemination of 2019-nCoV cases across the country (Fig. 3B), providing important epidemiological information that is much less affected by delayed- or under-reporting bias. The management of the epidemic over the coming weeks when people travel back from their hometowns to their work places will be critical for being able to bring it under control. We recommend that the national and local authorities process real-time human movement data through mathematical models to forecast the spatio-temporal dynamics of further 2019-nCoV outbreaks across Mainland China. This will allow developing early detection, isolation and quarantine strategies tailored to the very dynamic epidemiological situation, as well as identify potential problems in the implementation of local disease control policies and inform the design of any necessary adjustments.",

From this selected list of 12 provinces and municipalities, Zhejiang Province and Jiangsu Province were excluded from our latent infection ratio estimation because of known substantial secondary local transmissions, given that the first objective of our study is to estimate the latent infection ratio in Wuhan during the early stage of the epidemic. For the remaining 10 provinces and municipalities, to accommodate the commonly-assumed 7-day incubation period for 2019nCoV, we calculated the ratio between the count of confirmed cases between January 23, 2020 and January 29, 2020, and the number of people travelling from Wuhan during the period of January 16, 2020 and January 22, 2020. Table S1 presents these counts and the calculated ratios. Seven provinces and municipalities offered detailed information concerning secondary local transmissions when publishing daily case counts.

            "The resulting estimated latent infection ratio is 0.12% (95% CI: 0.09%-0.15%). Using this ratio, we in turn estimated that there were 18,556 (95% CI: 14,134-22,978) L&I persons (out of 15.34 million population) in Wuhan before the city\u2019s lockdown. Among these L&I persons, 7,670 traveled to other destinations in Mainland China while the rest 10,886 remained in Wuhan.",

To investigate the 2019-nCoV epidemic, we adopted a the SEIRDC model (14), which enhances the standard SEIR model by introducing an additional category of persons, Dead, and an auxiliary variable  ( ) that tracks the cumulative number of infectious persons during the outbreak.
