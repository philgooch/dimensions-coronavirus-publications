        "abstract": "Wuhan coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by January 30, 2020. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.",

            "3.1 Sequence identity analysis The sequence identity is defined as the percentage of characters which match exactly between two different sequences. The sequence identities between 2019-nCoV protease and some other coronaviral proteases are presented in Table 1. It is seen that 2019-nCoV protease is very close to SARS-CoV protease, but is distinguished from other proteases. Clearly, 2019-nCoV has a strong genetic relationship with SARS-CoV. Additionally, the available experimental data of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors can be used as the training set to generate new inhibitors of 2019-nCoV protease. 3.2 Structure similarity analysis The 2019-nCoV protease (PDB ID 6lu7) and SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2gx4) have an excellent similarity. As shown in Fig. 2, two crystal structures are essentially identical to each other. Particularly, the RMSD of two crystal structures at the binding site is 0.53 \u00c5. When we try to carry a homology modeling of 2019-nCoV protease structure from its sequence using SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2gx4) as a model, the resulting 2019-nCoV protease homology structure has an RMSD of 0.9 \u00c5 (or 0.2 \u00c5 at the binding site region) with its crystal structure 6lu[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The high structural similarity between the two proteases suggests that anti-SARS-CoV chemicals can be equally effective for the treatment of 2019-nCoV."

            "Wuhan pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), called 2019-nCoV, has led to heavy economic loss and human fatalities. Under the current health emergency, it is vital to develop an effective treatment for this<br/><br/>2019-nCoV protease and lopinavir complex lopinavir, -8.44 kcal/mol<br/><br/>2019-nCoV protease and ritonavir complex ritonavir, -7.78 kcal/mol epidemic. Although we know quite a little about 2019-nCoV, it is fortunate that the sequence identity of the 2019nCoV protease and that of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. In this work, we show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. Additionally, we employed a recently developed generative network complex (GNC) to seek potential protease inhibitors for effective treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV. Two datasets are utilized in this work. One is a SARS-CoV protease inhibitor dataset, which is constructed by collecting 115 SRAS-CoV inhibitors from open database ChEMBL. The other dataset is a binding affinity training set mainly containing the PDBbind refined set. Our GNC model predicts over 8000 potential anti-2019-nCoV drugs which are evaluated by a latent space binding predictor (LS-BP) and a 2D fingerprint predictor (2DFP). Promising drug candidates are further evaluated by two 3D deep learning models trained with all the training sets together, including the dataset for coronaviral protease (3DALL), and the 3D deep learning multitask model trained with the dataset for coronaviral protease as a separated task (3DMT). Furthermore, we choose 15 potential anti-2019nCoV drugs to analyze partition coefficient (logP), solubility (logS), and synthetic accessibility score (SAscore) according to binding affinity ranking computed by the 3DALL model. The reasonable logP, logS, and SAscore show that our top 15 anti-2019-nCoV drug candidates are potentially effective for inhibiting 2019-nCoV. Finally, the effectiveness of some anti-HIV/AIDS drugs for treating 2019-nCoV is analyzed. Although HIV drugs Kaletra (or Aluvia) and Norvir might indeed have a moderate effect in the treatment of 2019-nCoV, the analysis of these anti-HIV/AIDS drugs together with our top 15 anti-2019-nCoV molecules shows that the new compounds generated by our GNC appear to have better druggable properties than these HIV inhibitors do."

Under the current health emergency, many researchers around the world engaged in the investigation of the genetic and functional data of 2019-nCoV and compare to other coronaviruses to design proper infection control strategy[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and seek potential drugs that can prevent and/or cure this serious epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]",

Therefore, the 2019-nCoV should be considered as a new type of bat coronavirus. However, this observation raised a worth-thinking issue whether the 2019-nCoV has the same infective mechanisms as the human SARS-CoV.",

GRUs can deal with the vanishing gradient problem occurred in recurrent neural network (RNN) models but are simpler than long-short-term memory (LSTM) models. GRUs are suitable for moderately complex sequences, such as small molecular SMILES strings. A pre-trained autoencoder model developed by Winter et al is adopted in the present work.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] The latent space vector (X \u2208 Rn) or molecular representation has the dimension of 512 (n = 512)."

In the first step, the latent space representation of a seed molecule is evaluated for their drug-like properties, such as binding affinities, solubility (logS), partition coefficient, similarity, etc., via pre-trained DNNs. The DNN consists of two hidden layers with 1024 neurons in each layer. In our second step, evaluation results ({yi(X)} ) are compared with a set of target values ({yi0}) via a loss function, 1m",

The resulting new vector X is sent back to the pre-trained DNNs for reevaluation until the loss function is smaller than a given tolerance. Only the desirable molecule representation X is sent to the decoder to generate a SMILES string. Alternatively, a Monte Carlo procedure can be used to replace the gradient decent. 2.3 2D fingerprint-based predictor (2DFP) New SMILES strings generated by the decoder is passed to 2D fingerprint-based predictors (2DFPs) to reevaluate druggable properties.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] These predictors are pre-trained deep neural networks involving multiple hidden layers with hundreds or even thousands of neurons on each layer.

In this training set, the calculated root mean squared deviations (RMSDs) between the decoy and native structures are used as machine learning labels. Then, we set up MathDL models and apply them to pick up the top-ranked pose for the given ligand. The MathPose-generated top poses are fed to the MathDL for druggable property evaluation.

It is seen that 2019-nCoV protease is very close to SARS-CoV protease, but is distinguished from other proteases. Clearly, 2019-nCoV has a strong genetic relationship with SARS-CoV. Additionally, the available experimental data of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors can be used as the training set to generate new inhibitors of 2019-nCoV protease. 3.2 Structure similarity analysis The 2019-nCoV protease (PDB ID 6lu7) and SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2gx4) have an excellent similarity. As shown in Fig. 2, two crystal structures are essentially identical to each other. Particularly, the RMSD of two crystal structures at the binding site is 0.53 \u00c5. When we try to carry a homology modeling of 2019-nCoV protease structure from its sequence using SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2gx4) as a model, the resulting 2019-nCoV protease homology structure has an RMSD of 0.9 \u00c5 (or 0.2 \u00c5 at the binding site region) with its crystal structure 6lu[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].

Although we know quite a little about 2019-nCoV, it is fortunate that the sequence identity of the 2019nCoV protease and that of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. In this work, we show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. Additionally, we employed a recently developed generative network complex (GNC) to seek potential protease inhibitors for effective treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV. Two datasets are utilized in this work. One is a SARS-CoV protease inhibitor dataset, which is constructed by collecting 115 SRAS-CoV inhibitors from open database ChEMBL. The other dataset is a binding affinity training set mainly containing the PDBbind refined set. Our GNC model predicts over 8000 potential anti-2019-nCoV drugs which are evaluated by a latent space binding predictor (LS-BP) and a 2D fingerprint predictor (2DFP). Promising drug candidates are further evaluated by two 3D deep learning models trained with all the training sets together, including the dataset for coronaviral protease (3DALL), and the 3D deep learning multitask model trained with the dataset for coronaviral protease as a separated task (3DMT). Furthermore, we choose 15 potential anti-2019nCoV drugs to analyze partition coefficient (logP), solubility (logS), and synthetic accessibility score (SAscore) according to binding affinity ranking computed by the 3DALL model. The reasonable logP, logS, and SAscore show that our top 15 anti-2019-nCoV drug candidates are potentially effective for inhibiting 2019-nCoV. Finally, the effectiveness of some anti-HIV/AIDS drugs for treating 2019-nCoV is analyzed. Although HIV drugs Kaletra (or Aluvia) and Norvir might indeed have a moderate effect in the treatment of 2019-nCoV, the analysis of these anti-HIV/AIDS drugs together with our top 15 anti-2019-nCoV molecules shows that the new compounds generated by our GNC appear to have better druggable properties than these HIV inhibitors do."
