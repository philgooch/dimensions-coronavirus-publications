            "Recent coronavirus zoonotic transmissions have involved non-bat intermediates. Indeed, both SARS15 and MERS16 are believed to have arisen from coronaviruses recombining in civet cats and camels, respectively. While early indications for nCoV-2019 showed that the virus may have jumped directly from bats to humans[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], here we present evidence that nCoV-2019 likely arose from yet another recombined coronavirus in an intermediate host. A dataset describing the viral diversity in Malayan pangolins[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] yielded a coronavirus genome that shares 89% nucleotide (Figure 1A and 1B) and 98% amino acid (Figure 1C) identity across the same RBM segment with nCoV-2019. Additionally, the RaTG13 genome only shares one out of five key amino acids involved in receptor binding motif[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], whereas the pangolin coronavirus shares all five key residues (Figure 1C). It therefore appears that the RBM in nCoV-2019 was introduced during a recombination event between the strain of coronavirus found in the pangolin and RaTG13. Given the heavy selective pressure under which the RBM is constrained, it is unlikely that RaTG13 acquired the mutations found in the pangolin coronavirus genome through random chance. We posit that the homology at the RBM between nCoV-2019 and a pangolin coronavirus may have arisen from a recombination event based on sequence analysis presented herein. Amino acid alignment between pangolin coronavirus and nCoV-2019 at the S1-NTD subdomain results in low sequence similarity. However, increased similarity is observed from the RBD through the S2 domain (Figure 1A-B). This suggests a possible recombination event between a bat coronavirus and the pangolin coronavirus at the S1-NTD and RBD junction. While there is high conservation at the amino-acid level between the pangolin coronavirus and nCoV-2019, this is not reflected in the nucleotide identity, suggesting that the proposed recombination event occurred in the more distant past, allowing subsequent time for genetic drift. One such mutation could be the insertion of the amino acid residues PRRA near the S1/S2 junction which induces a furin cleavage motif. The secondary requirement for entry into the host cell is proteolytic cleavage of the S1/S2 domains in order to mediate membrane fusion post ACE2 binding 4, and introduction of the furin cleavage motif may be another factor in nCoV-2019 being able to replicate in humans (Figure 2)."

            "The main limitations of this analysis are the lack of additional viral datasets arising from pangolins or the availability of coronavirus genomes isolated from pangolins that could be used for multiple genome alignments with nCoV-2019. In addition, the current analysis only focuses on the spike protein of nCoV-2019 without exploring additional recombination events that may lead to changes in host tropism. Nonetheless, the identification of a possible recombination event in the host-receptor binding protein of nCoV-2019, suggesting an intermediate host, supports a call for continuous surveillance of species known to be infected by this group of viruses, including pangolins, as well as all small mammals sold in such wet markets as the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan to better understand and characterize zoonotic transmission events."
