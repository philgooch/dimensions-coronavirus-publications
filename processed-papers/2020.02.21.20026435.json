        "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in multiple countries including Singapore as of March 5, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0 around February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7,1.0) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscore the significant effects of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.",

        "discussion": [
            "Overall, current estimates of transmission potential in Singapore, based on two different data sources and different methods, suggest that temporary local transmission potential of SARS-CoV2 has occurred in Singapore while our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number and the overall reproduction number derived from the distribution of cluster sizes are below the epidemic threshold of 1.0. Temporary sustained transmission at the beginning of the epidemic can be attributed to multiple case importations and initiation of local transmission in the region. However, as cases get identified, transmission potential starts to decline in early February 2020. While large-scale transmission has not been reported in Singapore, the fact that asymptomatic and subclinical cases are now well documented for COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>] suggests that our estimates could be underestimated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. On the other hand, it is not clear if asymptomatic or subclinical cases are as infectious as symptomatic cases. Indeed, we have reported that multiple local cases have yet to be traced to existing transmission chains. Additional data collected during the course of the outbreak will help obtain an improved picture of the transmission dynamics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. These findings emphasize the need to strengthen public health interventions including active case contact tracing activities in countries with emerging transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that current data suggests that imported cases have contributed little to secondary cases in Singapore, with most of the imported cases dating back to the early phase of the epidemic. However, there are examples such as the Grant Hayatt Singapore cluster and the Yong Thai cluster that were linked to imported sources, and the original sources had left Singapore before these local clusters emerged [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]."

However, it is possible to adjust epidemic curves by reporting delays using statistical methods [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>].

This model characterizes the growth profile via three parameters: the growth rate (r), the scaling of the growth parameter (p) and the final epidemic size (K). The GLM can reproduce a range of early growth dynamics, including constant growth (p=0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0<p<1), and exponential growth (p=1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>].

This is parameterized by the effective reproduction number, R, and the dispersion parameter, k. The reproduction number provides the average number of secondary cases per index case, and the dispersion parameter varies inversely with the heterogeneity of the infectious disease. This parameterization allows variation in the both the strength and heterogeneity of disease transmission, where a lower dispersion parameter indicates higher transmission heterogeneity. Assuming each cluster of infection is initiated by a single infection, branching process theory provides an analytic representation of the size distribution of cluster sizes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>].

This pattern aligns well with past outbreaks of SARS and MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], including substantial nosocomial transmission during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Thus, the distributions of cluster sizes for SARS and MERS outbreaks are characterized by high heterogeneity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. To minimize the risk of hospital-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the Ministry of Health of Singapore has restricted the movement of patients and staff across hospitals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Also, because multiple unlinked community cases of COVID-19 have been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], various social distancing measures have been put in place including advising the public against large social gatherings in order to mitigate the risk of community transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. These social distancing measures reduce the risk of onward transmission not only within Singapore, but also beyond the borders of this highly connected nation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>].",
            "The reproduction number is a key threshold quantity to assess the transmission potential of an emerging disease such as COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. It quantifies the average number of secondary cases generated per case. If the reproduction number is below 1.0, infections occur in isolated clusters as self-limited chains of transmission, and persistence of the disease would require continued undetected importations. On the other hand, reproduction numbers above 1.0 indicate sustained community transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Using epidemiological data and mathematical modeling tools, we are monitoring the effective reproduction number, Rt, of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Singapore in real-time, and here we report the evolution of Rt by February 27, 2020. Specifically, we assess the effective reproduction number from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset after adjusting for reporting delays, and we also derive an estimate of the reproduction number based on the characteristics of the clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Overall, current estimates of transmission potential in Singapore, based on two different data sources and different methods, suggest that temporary local transmission potential of SARS-CoV2 has occurred in Singapore while our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number and the overall reproduction number derived from the distribution of cluster sizes are below the epidemic threshold of 1.0. Temporary sustained transmission at the beginning of the epidemic can be attributed to multiple case importations and initiation of local transmission in the region. However, as cases get identified, transmission potential starts to decline in early February 2020. While large-scale transmission has not been reported in Singapore, the fact that asymptomatic and subclinical cases are now well documented for COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>] suggests that our estimates could be underestimated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. On the other hand, it is not clear if asymptomatic or subclinical cases are as infectious as symptomatic cases. Indeed, we have reported that multiple local cases have yet to be traced to existing transmission chains. Additional data collected during the course of the outbreak will help obtain an improved picture of the transmission dynamics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. These findings emphasize the need to strengthen public health interventions including active case contact tracing activities in countries with emerging transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that current data suggests that imported cases have contributed little to secondary cases in Singapore, with most of the imported cases dating back to the early phase of the epidemic. However, there are examples such as the Grant Hayatt Singapore cluster and the Yong Thai cluster that were linked to imported sources, and the original sources had left Singapore before these local clusters emerged [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>].",
            "Our Rt estimates for Singapore are substantially lower than mean estimates reported for the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which range from: 2.2-7.1 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>]. This indicates that containment efforts are having a significant impact in Singapore. However, some differences in the reproduction numbers reported for the epidemic in China may result from different methods, differences in data sources, and time periods used to estimate the reproduction number. Similarly, a recent study has shown an average reporting delay of 6.1 days in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>] which agrees with our mean estimate for local cases in Singapore (7.7 days). Moreover, the scaling parameter for growth rate (p) indicates a sub-exponential growth pattern in Singapore, reflecting the effective isolation and control strategies in the region. This is consistent with a sub-exponential growth pattern for Chinese provinces excluding Hubei (p~0.67), as estimated by a recent study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>]; whereas, an exponential growth pattern was estimated for Hubei (p~1.0) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>].",
            "A previous study on the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea reported substantial potential for superspreading transmission despite a subcritical Rt [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. The lower estimate of the dispersion parameter in our study also indicate significant transmission heterogeneity in Singapore. Superspreading events of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV associated with nosocomial outbreaks are well documented and driven largely by substantial diagnostic delays [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Although the average delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis for COVID-19 patients in Singapore is at 7.7 days and no super-spreading events has been observed yet, the dispersion parameter, k<1, indicates the probability of observing large clusters and the potential for super-spreading [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. Therefore, public health measures enacted by public health authorities in Singapore that advise the public to avoid mass gatherings and confined places are crucial to prevent disease amplification events. However, the presence of asymptomatic cases in the community represent an ongoing threat [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>] although it is not currently known if subclinical cases are less infectious. This highlights the need for rapid testing suspected cases to quickly isolate those that test positive for the novel coronavirus. To achieve this goal, public health authorities in Singapore are reactivating 900 general practitioner (GP) clinics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. Field investigations have identified cases linked to the \u201cGrace Assembly of God\u201d and the \u201cLife Church and Missions\u201d in Singapore, a large cluster seeded by the Wuhan visitors. Our overall estimate for R does not differ considerably if these two churches are analyzed as a single large cluster or as two smaller clusters. While new clusters emerge, some clusters including the Yong Thai Hang cluster and the Grand Hayatt cluster have stabilized (no recent additional cases in most clusters). The Grace Assembly of God\u201d and the \u201cLife Church and Missions\u201d cluster continues to be consolidated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>].",
            "Beyond Singapore, COVID-19 clusters are being reported in an increasing number of countries including Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and on the Diamond Cruise ship in Japan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>]. Moreover, Singapore has also produced secondary chains of disease transmission beyond its borders [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Although Singapore has been detecting and isolating cases with diligence, our findings underscore the need for continued and sustained containment efforts to prevent largescale community transmission including nosocomial outbreaks. Overall, the current situation in Singapore highlights the need to investigate the unlinked and asymptomatic cases that could be a potential source of secondary cases and amplified transmission in confined settings. Although Singapore has a world-class health system including a highly efficient contact tracing mechanism in place [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], continued epidemiological investigations and active case finding efforts are needed to control the outbreak.",
            "Our study is not exempt from limitations. First, the outbreak is still ongoing and we continue to monitor the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore. Second, onset dates are missing in twelve cases, which were excluded from our analyses. Third, we cannot rule out that additional cases will be added to existing clusters, which may lead to underestimating the reproduction number based on the cluster size distribution. Finally, the cluster size analysis is modeled under the assumption that there is one primary case (i.e. all cases can be connected eventually to one person), rather than being multiple imported cases. As more data become available, more theoretical work could be extended to account for the uncertainty regarding the primary number of cases per cluster and the possibility of ongoing transmission in some clusters."
