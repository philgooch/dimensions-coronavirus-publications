        "abstract": "Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.",

            "Here we report the expression pattern of ACE2 in the human intestine at single-cell resolution. Our data suggest that ACE2 is specifically expressed by colonocytes and positively associated with viral entry and egress, consistent with observations that the gastrointestinal tract is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection. In supportive of the view that ACE2 expression prevents intestinal inflammation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], bioinformatic analysis suggested that genes regulating type I and type III innate immunity, NK and T cell mediated cytotoxicity and energy metabolism are positively associated with ACE2 expression. By contrast, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation are negatively associated with ACE2 expression. These findings may facilitate concurrent and future investigations of the nature and function of the immune system at systemic and local levels in patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia.<br/><br/>Notably, SARS-CoV spike protein engagement downregulates ACE2 expression and activates the RAS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Given that hypertension is common in severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], it is highly likely that the RAS is activated in the lungs of patients with severe pneumonia. The Xa inhibitor Rivaroxaban [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and the AT1R blocker valsartan (DOI:10.1183/13993003.congress2019.PA2469) are effective in relieving pulmonary injury and embolism in experimental models and clinical trials, their efficacy in treating 2019-nCoV may worth consideration. Dipyridamole is another anti-coagulation drug. In a pilot trial, dipyridamole administration promoted mucosal healing and improved clinical symptoms in patients with colitis or IBD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. More importantly, published clinical studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], including those conducted in China (DOI: CNKI:SUN:XIYI.0.2010-12-026;[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]; CNKI:SUN:YXLT.0.2014-32-031), have demonstrated that dipyridamole has broad spectrum antiviral activity against virus infections. It may also be worth investigating the therapeutic effects of dipyridamole in patients infected by 2019-nCoV."

            "Apart from the lung, ACE2 is also associated with gut function. ACE2 expression in the gut epithelial cells is required for maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and the ecology of gut microbiome in the intestine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. We had previously generated a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from control subjects and those with colitis or IBD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Using this dataset, we examined ACE2 expression and found that it was specifically and highly expressed by the colonocytes (Figure 1 A-B). Compared with other epithelial subtypes, colonocytes overexpressed genes regulating viral entry, budding and releasing from the host cells (VAPA, CHMP4C, CHMP1A, CHMP2B, CHMP4B, CHMP1B, VPS37B, PDCD6IP, VPS4B, CHMP3, VPS28, CHMP2A, PVRL2, CDH1, and MVB12A). Genes involved in nucleic acid sensing and type I, type III interferon signaling (R2RX4, DDX58, NLRC5, IFNAR2, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2), pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine (IL18, IL32, CXCL16, CXCL3, CXCL2, CXCL1, CCL28, CCL20) production, antigen presentation via MHC class I molecules (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-E) and cytokine receptors (IL2G, IL10RB, and IL6R) were also enriched in colonocytes (Figure 1C).",
            "Given that ACE2 plays dual roles in mediating viral entry and preventing tissue injury [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], we analyzed genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 in the colonic epithelial cells. In total, 3420 and 2136 genes were positively and negatively correlated with ACE2 expression, respectively (Supplementary table 1 and Figure 2A). In Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, genes positively correlated with ACE2 expression were enriched in viral infection and egress (viral budding via host ESCRT complex, positive regulation of viral release from host cells, viral entry into host cells), innate immune responses (type I interferon signaling pathway and toll-like receptor signaling pathway), NK and T cell cytotoxicity (interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, regulation of natural killer cell mediated immunity, positive regulation of T cell mediated cytotoxicity), energy metabolism (triglyceride biosynthetic process, pyruvate metabolic process, NADH metabolic process, mitochondrial electron transport), inflammation and apoptosis (positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling and positive regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway). In contrast, genes negatively correlated with ACE2 were enriched for humoral immunity (positive regulation of B cell activation, antibacterial humoral response, mature B cell differentiation, B cell receptor signaling pathway, immunoglobulin production), protein translation (ribosomal big and small subunit assembly and translational initiation), phagocytosis (Fc-epsilon receptor signaling pathway, Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway involved in phagocytosis, phagocytosis recognition) and classical pathway of complement activation (Figure 2B)."

        "Discussion": [
            "Here we report the expression pattern of ACE2 in the human intestine at single-cell resolution. Our data suggest that ACE2 is specifically expressed by colonocytes and positively associated with viral entry and egress, consistent with observations that the gastrointestinal tract is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection. In supportive of the view that ACE2 expression prevents intestinal inflammation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], bioinformatic analysis suggested that genes regulating type I and type III innate immunity, NK and T cell mediated cytotoxicity and energy metabolism are positively associated with ACE2 expression. By contrast, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation are negatively associated with ACE2 expression. These findings may facilitate concurrent and future investigations of the nature and function of the immune system at systemic and local levels in patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",
            "Notably, SARS-CoV spike protein engagement downregulates ACE2 expression and activates the RAS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Given that hypertension is common in severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], it is highly likely that the RAS is activated in the lungs of patients with severe pneumonia. The Xa inhibitor Rivaroxaban [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and the AT1R blocker valsartan (DOI:10.1183/13993003.congress2019.PA2469) are effective in relieving pulmonary injury and embolism in experimental models and clinical trials, their efficacy in treating 2019-nCoV may worth consideration. Dipyridamole is another anti-coagulation drug. In a pilot trial, dipyridamole administration promoted mucosal healing and improved clinical symptoms in patients with colitis or IBD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. More importantly, published clinical studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], including those conducted in China (DOI: CNKI:SUN:XIYI.0.2010-12-026;[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]; CNKI:SUN:YXLT.0.2014-32-031), have demonstrated that dipyridamole has broad spectrum antiviral activity against virus infections. It may also be worth investigating the therapeutic effects of dipyridamole in patients infected by 2019-nCoV."
