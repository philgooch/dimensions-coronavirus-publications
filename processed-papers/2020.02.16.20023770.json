        "abstract": "Objective\nTo reconstruct the transmission trajectory of SARS-COV-2 and analyze the effects of control measures in China.\nMethods\nPython 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas.\nResults\nBasic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073, 21342 and 13384 infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively, and there would be 2179, 633 and 107 death in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively.\nConclusion\nA series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic will end in early April.",

Sequences of 2 complete viral genomes of 29.8 kilobases (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) obtained from 2 patients with the pneumonia were identified, and a novel lineage B coronavirus closely related to bat SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (NCBI accession number MG772934) and bat-SL-CoVZC45 (NCBI accession number MG772933) was revealed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].

            "In the first stage of SARS-COV-2 transmission in Wuhan, the true number of infections was much higher than the officially announced probably because that people did not know",
            "COVID-19 is contagious and the local government did not take any control measure. In this stage, the infected cases were not effectively diagnosed, isolated, and treated, which led to rapid transmission of COVID-19. In the second stage, the trend of exponential growth of infection was suddenly controlled. The reason may be that Wuhan city was closed, people got the news that COVID-19 was contagious, and more and more medical resources were put into Wuhan. The medical capacity was still not sufficient to isolate every suspected or confirmed case and many infected people could not been treated or isolated timely. In the third stage, infected number growth curve in Wuhan showed a turning point and a gradual decline, possibly due to the input of medical resources and the strengthening of control measures. In the fourth stage, after February 13, 2020, the number of infected cases decreased rapidly, which is likely due to the substantial investment of medical resources and the strengthening of control measures, including the adoption of the new diagnostic standard \"clinical diagnostic standard\".

            "The outbreak of COVID-19 posed a major challenge to China's Health system. Although the early human-to-human transmissions were described in the scientific literature, the local government of Hubei was not aware of the severity and did not inform the public timely, resulting in the public have no awareness of protection. Meanwhile, more than 5 million people left Wuhan with about 1960 infected among them during this time, and the outbreak spread across the country. At the very early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, hospitals in Hubei Province had a serious shortage of medical protective equipment in routine reserves, which became the key limitation factor in controlling the outbreak. These defects should be improved in the future.",
            "On February 12, 2020, the new diagnostic standard \"clinical diagnostic standard\" was adopted in Hubei province. Vast majority of new clinically diagnosed cases were diagnosed from accumulated suspected cases. Clinical diagnosis standard is different from the laboratory diagnosis standard widely used in the world. On February 12, 2020, Health Commission of Hubei Province announced that there were 14840 new confirmed cases in Hubei (including 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases). This does not mean that the epidemic trend has become worse. It is just a reflection of the change of diagnostic standards and the intensification of control measures. Data from Official of Hubei Province on February 12, 2020 were not used in this study, but could be used to evaluate some results of this study.",

Second, there was no accurate medical resource limitation published especially in Wuhan and we estimated the media limitation by the maximum number of infected announced in the early stage and the added capacity of new hospitals in the later stage."
