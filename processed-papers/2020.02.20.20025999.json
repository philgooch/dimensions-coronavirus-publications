Pept-2 has only 70% identity to SARS\u2019s in amino acid composition but are not in continued sequence and the antibodies generated by Pept-2 will have the highest possibility to be COVID-19 specific.

            "Recently, a novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, broke out from Wuhan, China, had spread rapidly around the country and now the rest of world. The pneumonia symptoms manifested by this virus are similar to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which lead to acute respiratory syndrome. Until Feb 14th, 2020, 63,932 people confirmed to be infected by COVID-19 with [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,596] deaths in China1. Comparatively, SARS-CoV infected a total of more than 8,000 persons with 774 deaths in 37 additional countries in 20032. More seriously, the infections among doctors and family clusters demonstrated that it could transmission among humans3-6, more aggressively than what were observed with the SARS outbreak in 2003. Making the issue even worse, the virus could be widely transmitted by asymptomatic virus-carriers to people in close contact7 and some of the patients will still carry the virus even after they recovered from the diseases. RT-PCR has been used since the first day to screen the suspected and now used for confirmation of diagnosis for COVID-19 infection due to the lack of immunologic diagnostic assays for the new virus8. Molecular diagnosis requires both special laboratory setting and very skilled laboratory personnel, which are both highly limited in Wuhan and the heavily hit surrounding epidemic areas. False negative rate was alarming at 30-40% with RT-PCR of throat swabs due to many different reasons. It is urgent to develop rapid, fast and simple screening tools to find the \u201cmoving source of virus\u201d and quarantine them.",
            "COVID-19 contains Nucleoprotein (N-protein), Spike glycoprotein (S-protein), Envelope protein (E-protein) and Membrane protein (M-protein)9. Ideally, developing antibody against the S protein will be the best approach since S plays very important roles in virus entering by binding to the target receptor on the cell surface. However, S protein is a heavily glycosylated protein10 and many groups have tried to express the COVID-19 S protein in mammalian cells with limited success. On the other hand, N-protein is produced at very high levels in the virus infected cells and is considered to be a good candidate for clinic diagnosis11.",

In this study, 5 linear sequences, SDNGPQSNQRNAPRITFG (Pept-1,a.a.2-19), PSDSTGSNQNGERSGARSKQ (Pept-2, a.a.20-39), PGSSRGTSPARMAGNGGDAALA (Pept-3, a.a.199-220), PKKDKKKKADETQALPQRQKK (Pept-4, a.a.368-388) and GGSADSTQA (Pept-5, a.a.413-419) were selected as the potential linear epitopes on the outer surfaces of COVID-19 NP.",

Pept-1 shares 88.9% identify with the SARS NP, and no homology to the MERS\u2019 and the other 4 coronaviruses\u2019 NP. Pept-5 is 100% identical in COVID-19 and SARS, no homology with the rest 5 viruses. The other three sequences were selected based more on the specificity and immunogenicity other than the locations in the protein. Pept-2 has only 70% identity to SARS\u2019s in amino acid composition but are not in continued sequence and the antibodies generated by Pept-2 will have the highest possibility to be COVID-19 specific. Pept-3 has 77% homology with SARS and 50% identity to MERS at the very end of NT of the peptide. Pept-4 has the strongest immunogenicity and its NT has very high homology with both SARS and MERS.",

As you can see, clone 6F10 mAb had the highest titer against COVID-19\u2019s NP with minimal cross-reactivity to SARS\u2019s NP, and no significant reactivity to MERS\u2019s NP. On the contrary, clone 3A3 and 1F7 reacted equally well to NPs from COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Clone 3A10 and 8C3 recognized NPs from COVID-19 and SARS, but not the one from MERS. Our data suggested that even with such short of sequence, there could be many different antigen epitopes that can generate different mAbs with different specificities.",
