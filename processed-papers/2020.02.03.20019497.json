        "abstract": "Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.\nMethods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.\nResults: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).\nConclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.",

            "The epidemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections that began in<br/><br/>China in late 2019 has rapidly grown and cases have been reported worldwide.<br/><br/>An empirical estimate of the serial interval\u2014the time from illness onset in a primary case (infector) to illness onset in a secondary case (infectee)\u2014is needed to understand the turnover of case generations and transmissibility of the disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Estimates of the serial interval can only be obtained by linking dates of onset for infector-infectee pairs, and these links are not easily established. A recently published epidemiological study used contact tracing data from cases reported in<br/><br/>Hubei Province early in the epidemic to estimate the mean serial interval at 7.5 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], which is consistent with the 8.4-day mean serial interval reported for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from Singaporean household contact data [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. However, there were only six infector-infectee pairs in this dataset, and sampling bias may have been introduced to the variance and mean. To further assess the serial interval of COVID-19 infections we compiled a dataset of 28 publicly shared infector-infectee pairs and calculated the serial interval from these data."

Without truncation, the model using the lognormal distribution was also the best-fit model (WAIC=128.0) with the median serial interval was estimated at 3.9 days (95%    CrI: 3.1, 4.8).<br/><br/>Limiting our dataset to only certain observations, the median serial interval of the best-fit Weibull distribution model was estimated at 4.6 days (95%<br/><br/>CI: 3.5, 5.9) with a mean and SD of 4.8 days (95% CrI: 3.8, 6.1) and 2.3 days (95% CrI: 1.6, 3.5), respectively.

        ],
        "discussion": [
            "Our estimate of the median serial interval as 4.0 days indicates that<br/><br/>COVID-19 infection leads to rapid cycles of transmission from one generation of cases to the next. The shorter serial interval compared to SARS implies that contact tracing methods must compete against the rapid replacement of case generations, and the number of contacts may soon exceed what available healthcare and public health workers are able to handle. The difference between these distributions suggests that using serial intervals estimates from SARS data will result in overestimation of the COVID-19 basic reproduction number.<br/><br/>More importantly, the estimated median serial interval is shorter than the preliminary estimates of the mean incubation period (approximately 5 days)<br/><br/>[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. As illustrated in Figure 2, when the serial interval is shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission is likely to have taken place and may even occur more frequently than symptomatic transmission. A substantial proportion of secondary transmission occurring before illness onset indicates that many transmissions cannot be prevented solely through isolation of symptomatic cases, as by the time contacts are traced they may have already become infectious themselves and generated secondary cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]."

            "COVID-19 infection leads to rapid cycles of transmission from one generation of cases to the next. The shorter serial interval compared to SARS implies that contact tracing methods must compete against the rapid replacement of case generations, and the number of contacts may soon exceed what available healthcare and public health workers are able to handle. The difference between these distributions suggests that using serial intervals estimates from SARS data will result in overestimation of the COVID-19 basic reproduction number.",

As illustrated in Figure 2, when the serial interval is shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission is likely to have taken place and may even occur more frequently than symptomatic transmission.

            "substantial proportion of secondary transmission occurring before illness onset indicates that many transmissions cannot be prevented solely through isolation of symptomatic cases, as by the time contacts are traced they may have already become infectious themselves and generated secondary cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "Correct ascertainment of dates of illness onset is critical to the calculation of the serial interval. Considering the overall mild nature of the infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] it is possible that different reporting jurisdictions have different criteria for determining what qualifies as illness onset for COVID-2019 cases, which is a potential bias we are unable to account for.

Second, classification of the credibility of the data and comparing analyses including and excluding less certain (but nonetheless highly probable) pairs allowed us to determine that our results using all pairs (and therefore a greater sample size) did not differ significantly from the results using only the most credible data.",

            "To further assess the serial interval of COVID-19 infections the authors compiled a dataset of 28 publicly shared infector-infectee pairs and calculated the serial interval from these data"
