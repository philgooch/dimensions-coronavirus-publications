        "abstract": "Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)\uff0cTI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.",

        "discussion": [
            "Although some modeling studies on the epidemiological characteristics of 2019nCoV epidemic have been reported so far, they had some limitations, such as the data come from the early stage of the epidemic. Due to the rapid change of the epidemic situation and the closure of Wuhan on January 23, many parameters related to the model have also changed, which affect the applicability and reliability of the model. This study used the latest 2019 nCoV data in Wuhan area, analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 2019 nCoV epidemic after in Wuhan city was shut down. Compared with other studies, the R0 value produced in this study is smaller, indicating that the closure and subsequent measures have played an important role in the spread of the epidemic. The infection time index (TI) obtained in this study was higher than that of SARS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] and MERS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], but lower than that of 2019-nCoV in literatures[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] reported earlier. This result may be related to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, the lack of medical resources for early response, and the failure of timely diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. A large number of mild patients and asymptomatic virus carriers were not isolated in time. The incubation period (TE) is about 3 days, which is close to the data in the reference[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. According to the latest reported data, the cumulative number of people infected on February 13 and 14 was 35991 and 37914 respectively, which is close to the number predicted by our estimation (Table 2). According to this study, the number of infected people will reach the peak in February 19 at about 45000 infected individuals."

        "conclusions": [
            "With the implementation of more follow-up measures, including strict restrictions on people going out, accelerating the treatment of infected individuals, and clinical trials of new drugs, the development of 2019-nCoV epidemic in Wuhan will be effectively controlled, and the number of infected individuals will gradually decrease. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.

            "To establish the model, we firstly estimated the parameters of the susceptible (S), the exposed (E), the infected (I) and the recovery(R) based on the latest data issued on February 12:",
            "N = 200000, which is the total number of potential close contacts in Wuhan on February 12.",
            "S=N\u2500I, in which S is the number of the susceptible and I is the number of the infected.",
            "I0 = 425, which is the number of susceptible individuals at the beginning of the model run. E0 = 426, which is the number of exposed individuals at the beginning of the model run R0 = 28, which is the number of recovered individuals at the beginning of the model run Results and Analysis Epidemic prediction based on SEIR model The epidemic of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan was studied by SEIR modeling. The results showed that, at the time when Wuhan was closed, the number of initially infected individuals was I0 = 425, the number of initially exposed individuals was E0 = 426, and the number of initially recovered patients was R0 = 28. Next, we separated the data into two stages: January 22-February 7 and February 8February 12. In the first stage, TI = 14(interquartile range:14-14), TE = 3.0 ( interquartile range : 2.8-3.1 ) , R0 = 1.44 ( interquartile range : 1.40-1.47 ) (Figure 2). The data showed that the infectious time of the infected person (I) is 14 days, and the incubation period is about 3 days, which is close to the data (Interquartile range: 3.0-7.2) estimated in the reference [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] . The propagation base R0 of this study is 1.44, which is significantly lower than the R0 estimated by other papers before the closure of Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",
            "In the second stage (after February 8), we set the number of susceptible population N to be fixed at 200000, and the infection cycle of infected population decreased from 14 days to 4 days, i.e. TI = 4, which was estimated according to the data of 5 days from February 8 to February 12, so as to get the epidemic development trend of 90 days since January 22, including the number of infected people, the number of latent people and the number of recovered people (Figure 3, Table 3). The results showed that the number of infected people increased slowly in the early stage (January 22january 31), but during February 1-February 12, the number of infected people increased rapidly, which is expected to peak around February 19, reaching about 45000 people. Subsequently, the number of infections will decrease. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and the epidemic would end around the end of March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200000 will not increase.",
            "In Figure 3 and Figure 4, red line indicates the trend of cumulative infection number over time, blue line is the trend of cumulative rehabilitation number over time, and green line is the trend of cumulative latent number over time. Vertical dash line indicates the peak time of cumulative infection number.",

Epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV within 90 days after the closure of Wuhan city assuming the number of susceptible people n = 300000 (A) and 400000 (B) If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the number of susceptible population will continue to increase on the basis of current N = 200000. If the number of susceptible population increases to N = 300000, and other parameters remain unchanged, the peak number can increase to 75000, and the epidemic peak time will also be postponed at around February 21 (Figure 4). If it is increased to N = 400000 and other parameters remain unchanged, the peak number can be increased to 100000, and the epidemic peak will be postponed to around February 22 (Figure 4). Even in both cases, the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March."

        "Discussion": [
            "Although some modeling studies on the epidemiological characteristics of 2019nCoV epidemic have been reported so far, they had some limitations, such as the data come from the early stage of the epidemic. Due to the rapid change of the epidemic situation and the closure of Wuhan on January 23, many parameters related to the model have also changed, which affect the applicability and reliability of the model. This study used the latest 2019 nCoV data in Wuhan area, analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 2019 nCoV epidemic after in Wuhan city was shut down. Compared with other studies, the R0 value produced in this study is smaller, indicating that the closure and subsequent measures have played an important role in the spread of the epidemic. The infection time index (TI) obtained in this study was higher than that of SARS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] and MERS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], but lower than that of 2019-nCoV in literatures[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] reported earlier. This result may be related to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, the lack of medical resources for early response, and the failure of timely diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. A large number of mild patients and asymptomatic virus carriers were not isolated in time. The incubation period (TE) is about 3 days, which is close to the data in the reference[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. According to the latest reported data, the cumulative number of people infected on February 13 and 14 was 35991 and 37914 respectively, which is close to the number predicted by our estimation (Table 2). According to this study, the number of infected people will reach the peak in February 19 at about 45000 infected individuals."
        ],
        "Conclusions": [
            "With the implementation of more follow-up measures, including strict restrictions on people going out, accelerating the treatment of infected individuals, and clinical trials of new drugs, the development of 2019-nCoV epidemic in Wuhan will be effectively controlled, and the number of infected individuals will gradually decrease. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed.",
