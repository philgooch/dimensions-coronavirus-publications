        "abstract": "ABSTRACTHuman coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential.",

Interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells.",

Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential."

Such a structural switch may be triggered by different stimuli, including receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, and/or a reduction in pH. Because different species require different stimuli, coronaviruses enter cells at different subcellular sites.

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "Receptor recognition is the first, essential step of the virus infection process. The coronaviral S protein mediates virus entry into host cells by binding to a specific receptor. A combination of stimuli, e.g., receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage, and exposure to low pH results in rearrangement of the S protein and, consequently, to membrane fusion and virus entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Although the structure of both the HCoV-HKU1 S ectodomain and the receptor-binding domain has been resolved, the receptor determinant remains unknown [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>]. In a previous study, we showed that HCoV-HKU1 utilizes O-acetylated sialic acids on host cells as an attachment receptor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Here, we present data demonstrating that the protease KLK13 is required for HCoV-HKU1 infection of the respiratory epithelium.",
            "Human KLKs take part in multiple physiological processes, including skin desquamation, tooth enamel formation, kidney and brain function, and synaptic neural plasticity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>]. Also, recent studies demonstrate a role for some KLKs during viral infections. For instance, KLK8 plays a role in the proteolytic activation of the human papillomavirus capsid protein, thereby mediating virus entry into host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. Also, KLK5 and KLK12 are secreted into the respiratory tract, where they support replication of the influenza A virus by cleaving the hemagglutinin protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>]; however, these proteins belong to a large pool of cell surface proteases, the orchestrated action of which promotes virus replication.",
            "Here, we found that the yield of HCoV-HKU1 from HAE fell in the presence of SPINK6",
            "(inhibitor of KLK13) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>] and camostat (a broad range inhibitor of serine proteases).",
            "However, the first compound also inhibits other KLKs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>], while the second block the activity of a wide range of serine proteases and was used previously to demonstrate the role of",

The relatively low inhibition of HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of SPINK6 possibly results from nonoptimal compound concentration at the HAE cultures, and cytotoxicity at higher concentrations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. Broad spectrum protease inhibitors are now used widely for virus research, although their non-specific activity makes the results equivocal. For example, Matsuyama et al.",
            "showed recently that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK interferes with the activity of several proteases, and that its previously described inhibitory activity during MERS-CoV infection is not specific to furin; instead, its activity is due to non-specific inhibition of cathepsin L and",

            "Considering the small arsenal of tools available to researchers studying KLKs, only three compounds were readily available. Treating HAE cultures with these inhibitors revealed that only compounds designed to inhibit KLK13 hampered HCoV-HKU1 replication. However, the great similarity between different KLKs makes one doubt the specificity of these inhibitors, despite their performance in biochemical assays. Therefore, we decided to silence KLK13 in",
            "HAE cultures. This abolished virus replication ex vivo, thereby confirming the importance of",
            "KLK13 during infection. KLK13 is thought to be secreted and membrane-bound[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>].",
            "This study showed that HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE modulates the expression of different KLKs, including KLK13. In our study, KLKs expression was tested using semiquantitative PCR, and for that reason, we were unable to show the level of KLKs modulation after HCoV-HKU1. However, the pattern of virus-induced expression of several KLKs could be observed. KLK mechanism of activation is a complex process and until now it has only been proven that most KLK genes are regulated by steroids and other hormones [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>]. It is also important to remember, that KLK expression is regulated in a similar manner, and the induction of a single gene usually results in overexpression of the whole cluster [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. While one may assume that the virus stimulates KLK13 production to promote the infection, this up-regulation is likely a natural response of the damaged tissue, as KLKs were previously reported to take part also in tissue regeneration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>]. Further, increased expression of KLKs may be the response to the inflammatory process, as Seliga et al demonstrated that KLK-kinin system is a potent modulator of innate immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>].",
            "The experiments performed herein show the importance of KLK13 for virus entry into susceptible cells; therefore, we speculated that scattered distribution of different KLKs in different tissues may be one of the determinants of the HCoV-HKU1 tropism [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>]. We tested the purified enzyme expressed in the eukaryotic cells; however, we also developed a cell line constitutively expressing the enzyme. As an in vitro model for our studies, we used RD cells previously reported to carry attachment receptors for the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Here, using pseudoviruses decorated with S-HKU1 proteins we showed that KLK13 presence on RD cells is sufficient for virus entry and renders these cells permissive. Our experiments also showed that in contrast to previous reports, TMPRSS2 is not involved in this process[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. Furthermore, we observed that RD cells supported the replication of the virus in the presence of KLK13 and that this effect was reversed in the presence of the specific KLK13 inhibitor. We were, however, not able to culture the virus to high yields. HCoV-HKU1 replication in KLK13-expressing RD cells remained inefficient and RTqPCR assessment did not reveal significant increases in the amounts of viral RNA. For that reason, we are only able to detect viral sg mRNAs, which are considered to be the hallmark of coronaviral replication.We believe that this may be due to non-optimal infection conditions, which may include inappropriate KLK13 concentrations or low density of the entry receptor. Also, it is possible that RD cells may not support efficient replication of the virus due to factors unrelated to the entry process. Nonetheless, our results show that the HCoV-HKU1 entry receptor is present on RD cells, and we were able to trigger virus entry and replication; these findings warrant further exploration.",
            "Most coronaviral S proteins are processed into S1 and S2 subunits by host proteases, which allows conformational changes in the S protein and leads to fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>].

While the S1/S2 site is believed to be processed by furin during protein biosynthesis, the S2/S2\u2019 site is expected to be cleaved during virus entry. As we already knew that KLK13 is sufficient for HCoV-HKU1 infection of naturally non-permissive RD cells, we aimed to investigate whether this was the direct result of KLK13-mediated proteolytic cleavage of the S protein. For this, we employed the CleavEx method, in which peptide of interest is coupled to the carrier HmuY protein and then undergoes proteolytic cleavage by the enzyme being tested. We found that the S1/S2 site was efficiently cleaved by KLK13, whereas the",
