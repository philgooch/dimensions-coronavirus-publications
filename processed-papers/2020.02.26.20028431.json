        "abstract": "The COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days.  It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.",

            "In summary, we estimated the distribution of the generation time, incubation period, and the periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis for patients in Chinese provinces excluding Hubei. The current recommendation of 14-day quarantine period may be too short, resulting in a 6.7% failure rate. We recommend to increase the quarantine period to 22 days. The periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis changed significantly for patients who showed symptom before and after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, mostly likely driven by behavior change of the general public, and more effective public health control measures after January 23. On average, patients may become infectious 3.9 days before the onset of major symptoms. This, and the 6.6 days delay from symptom onset to diagnosis, severely hinders the effectiveness of contact tracing and quarantine, as evidenced by the 2.5% success rate of quarantine before symptom onset. The basic reproduction number is 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation. However, the majority of patients infects no more than one individual, and thus the outbreaks in these provinces are mostly driven by super spreaders. Because transmission can occur before symptom onset, the latent period (from being infected to becoming infectious) and infectious period cannot easily be estimated from case descriptions."

            "The COVID-19 outbreak in China has become a major global public health concern [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Many estimates of the scope and magnitude of the outbreak have been quickly published [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The basic reproduction number, which is the average number of secondary infections caused by an average infectious individual during entire infectious period in a susceptible population, has received much attention, as the epidemic can take off if R\" > 1. The basic reproduction number R\" for the novel coronavirus has been estimated to be between 2.2 and 6.47 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Unfortunately, the most important disease characteristic parameters such as the generation time (the time between being infected and infecting others), the incubation period, and the periods from symptom onset to diagnosis and isolation, are still unknown. The published studies used educated guesses, many of such guesses were based on SARS epidemics. However, these studies also suggest that COVID-19 outbreak has different characteristics than SARS, such as possible transmission before showing major symptoms, and possibly higher transmission rates. Thus, SARS epidemics may not be a reliable source of information for COVID-19.",
            "We aim to estimate the distributions of important periods related to the disease progression and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including the generation time, the incubation period, the periods from symptom onset to isolation and diagnosis. We also aim to estimate the basic reproduction number for COVID-19 in Chinese provinces excluding Hubei (where Wuhan is the provincial capital), because these provinces implemented strong contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation control strategies. The outbreak patterns in these provinces thus may provide crucial information for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries."
