        "abstract": "The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.",

These are in the form of matrices whose entries correspond to the expected total number of agestratified contacts per day for individuals belonging to each of 16 5-year age classes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. These estimated contact matrices are publicly available as supplementary material attached to Prem et al.\u2019s paper. Here we use the estimated social contact matrix for China to define the early age-structured transmission dynamics; this is formed from the country-specific social contact matrix k and a vector of age-specific susceptibilities z \u2013 whose entries scale the risk of transmission from contact with infected individuals to susceptible individuals of each age class. Based on age-structured data from the outbreak in China, we can estimate z. We then combine z with Prem et al.\u2019s estimates of the contact matrices in the other 151 countries to generate an estimate of an age-structured transmission structure for each of those countries.

That is, we assume that the reproduction matrix R is directly proportional to the contact matrix K. The constant of proportionality will be the ratio between the leading eigenvalues of the two matrices, i.e. R0 divided by the leading eigenvalue of K. To obtain the reproduction matrix for some other country, we just multiply its contact matrix by the constant of proportionality we estimate for China.<br/><br/>Figure 2 presents the estimated scaling factors based on the age distribution reported by two studies of the early dynamics in China: Li et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] which reports on the first 425 confirmed cases; and Yang et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] which examines data from the first 4021 confirmed cases.

        "discussion": [
            "Here we have developed a simple model for age-structured transmission of 2019-nCoV with two components: an age-structured contact matrix dependent on the behaviour of the host population and an age-dependent susceptibility profile dependent on physiological response to infection. By using a previously-estimated synthetic contact matrix and age-stratified data, we were able to estimate age-dependent susceptibility profiles based on the first 425 and the first 4,021 cases in China. We then combined these estimated profiles with estimates of age-stratified contacts in 151 other countries to give us transmission matrices for these countries from which we could estimate the scale of basic reproductive ratios in each country relative to China. We demonstrated that taking age-specific susceptibility into account results in substantially different predictions of transmission intensity by country relative to a model without age-specific susceptibility; countries with older populations are at substantially higher risk than countries with younger populations.<br/><br/>The predictions we have made are limited by two main elements. The first is the accuracy of the estimated contact matrices; although there are known issues (as discussed in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]) they remain our best estimate of agestructured contacts to date. Unfortunately, not all countries have an associated mixing matrix; many counties in Africa do not have the underlying demographic data to support the generation of the associated mixing matrix. Secondly, in inferring the age-dependent susceptibility, we are effectively generating a matrix Ri,j which determines the distribution of secondary confirmed cases in terms of current confirmed cases. We are therefore assuming that either younger individuals are unlikely to infected or if infected they are generally asymptomatic and play a minor role in onward transmission. If such asymptomatic infections transmit equally to symptomatic cases, then the scaling of the reproductive ratio is expected to be closer to Figure 1. Finally, it is worth stressing that these projections only inform about early phase of the outbreak in the absence of controls; the rapid and effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (contact-tracing, self-isolation and movement controls) can substantially reduce the reproductive ratio."

            "In Figure 3(a) we plot the scaling factors obtained through our consideration of age-dependent susceptibility (figure 2) against the factors obtained by assuming homogeneous susceptibility across age groups (figure 1). Allowing for age-dependent susceptibility substantially increases the amount of variation in scaling (and thus in basic reproductive ratio) by country, and in particular can lead us to predict much larger scaling factors. When the transmission structure is modelled as a simple scaling of a population\u2019s contact patterns, the variation in scaling is driven by the variation in average intensity of contacts (captured by the eigenvalue of the contact pattern matrix K) by country. When we incorporate age-dependent susceptibility, contact patterns involving members of highly susceptible age classes becomes particularly important - generating a",
            "core-group within the population. For COVID-19, this means that we see higher scaling factors in countries with older populations, since this usually means contacts involving older individuals are more common. In countries with comparitively younger populations, contacts involving older individuals are less common and so the capacity of the infection to spread is reduced relative to the purely-contact pattern based transmission model.",
            "This point is seen to hold for all countries investigated (Figures 1 and 2). In Figure 1, we see that without age-dependent susceptibility transmission is low in many European countries as well as in South Korea and Japan, and high in many African countries, consistent with the differences in daily number of contacts predicted by Prem et al driven by the proportion of children. However, the maps in Figure 2 demonstrate that when age-specific susceptibility is taken into account, the pattern of infectious potential by country is generally reversed. We then expect to see higher transmission in Eastern Europe (including Italy which had the largest number of cases in Europe in late February 2020) and Japan, and reduced transmission across Africa, central America, the Middle East and India."

        "4 Discussion": [
            "Here we have developed a simple model for age-structured transmission of 2019-nCoV with two components: an age-structured contact matrix dependent on the behaviour of the host population and an age-dependent susceptibility profile dependent on physiological response to infection. By using a previously-estimated synthetic contact matrix and age-stratified data, we were able to estimate age-dependent susceptibility profiles based on the first 425 and the first 4,021 cases in China. We then combined these estimated profiles with estimates of age-stratified contacts in 151 other countries to give us transmission matrices for these countries from which we could estimate the scale of basic reproductive ratios in each country relative to China. We demonstrated that taking age-specific susceptibility into account results in substantially different predictions of transmission intensity by country relative to a model without age-specific susceptibility; countries with older populations are at substantially higher risk than countries with younger populations.",
            "The predictions we have made are limited by two main elements. The first is the accuracy of the estimated contact matrices; although there are known issues (as discussed in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]) they remain our best estimate of agestructured contacts to date. Unfortunately, not all countries have an associated mixing matrix; many counties in Africa do not have the underlying demographic data to support the generation of the associated mixing matrix. Secondly, in inferring the age-dependent susceptibility, we are effectively generating a matrix Ri,j which determines the distribution of secondary confirmed cases in terms of current confirmed cases. We are therefore assuming that either younger individuals are unlikely to infected or if infected they are generally asymptomatic and play a minor role in onward transmission. If such asymptomatic infections transmit equally to symptomatic cases, then the scaling of the reproductive ratio is expected to be closer to Figure 1. Finally, it is worth stressing that these projections only inform about early phase of the outbreak in the absence of controls; the rapid and effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (contact-tracing, self-isolation and movement controls) can substantially reduce the reproductive ratio."
