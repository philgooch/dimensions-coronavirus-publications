        "abstract": "Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.",

Our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-nCoV outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other types of virus and human diseases as well."

Our network-based methodology combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. (A) Human coronavirus (HCoV) associated host proteins were collected from literatures and pooled to generate a pan-HCoV protein subnetwork. (B) Network proximity between drug targets and HCoV-associated proteins was calculated to screen for candidate repurposable drugs for HCoVs under the human protein interactome model. (C & D) Gene set enrichment analysis was utilized to validate the network-based prediction. (E) Top candidates were further prioritized for drug combinations using network-based method captured by the \u2018Complementary Exposure\u2019 pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. (F) Overall hypothesis of network-based methodology: (i) the proteins that functionally associate with HCoVs are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human interactome network; and (ii) proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common protein-protein interactions elucidated by the human interactome"

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2,494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was found in Wuhan, China. As of February 02, 2020, there have been over 14,000 cases with ~300 deaths for the 2019-nCoV pandemic (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html); furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. However, there are currently no effective medications against 2019-nCoV. Several national and international research groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019nCoV, but effective vaccines are not available yet. There is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV outbreak."

Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines.

In addition, targeting single virus proteins often have high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",

In total, we obtained 119 host proteins associated with CoVs with various experimental evidences. Specifically, these host proteins are either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or are involved in crucial pathways of HCoV infection. The HCoV-host interactome network is shown in Figure 3A. We identified several hub proteins including JUN, XPO1, NPM1, and HNRNPA1, with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed multiple significant biological pathways (adjusted P value < 0.05), including measles, RNA transport, NF-kappa B signaling, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and influenza (Figure 3B). Gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analyses further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes (adjusted P value < 0.001), including viral life cycle, modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology, viral process, positive regulation of viral life cycle, transport of virus, and virion attachment to host cell (Figure 3C). We then mapped the known drug-target network (see Methods) into the HCoV-host interactome to search for druggable, cellular targets. We found that 47 human proteins (39%, blue nodes in Figure 3A) can be targeted by at least one approved drug or experimental drug under clinical trial. For example, GSK3B, DPP4, SMAD3, PARP1, and IKBKB are the most targetable proteins.

Additionally, we downloaded the expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] to obtain drug-gene signatures. We calculated a GSEA score (see Methods) for each drug and used this score as an indication of bioinformatics validation of the 135 drugs. Specifically, an enrichment score (ES) was calculated for each HCoV data set, and ES > 0 and P < 0.05 (permutation test) was used as cut-off for a significant association of gene signatures between a drug and a specific HCoV. The GSEA score, ranging from 0 to 3, is the number of data sets that met these criteria for a specific drug. Mesalazine (an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease), sirolimus (an approved immunosuppressive drug), and equilin (an approved agonist of the estrogen receptor for menopausal symptoms) achieved the highest GSEA scores of 3, followed by paroxetine and melatonin with GSEA scores of 2. We next selected 16 potential repurposable drugs (Figure 5A and Table 1) against HCoVs using subject matter expertise based on a combination of factors: (i) strength of the network-predicted associations (a smaller network proximity score in Supplementary Table S4); (ii) validation by GSEA analyses;",

An overexpression of estrogen receptor has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. SERMs have been reported to play a broader role in inhibiting viral replication through the non-classical pathways associated with estrogen receptor[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. SERMs interfere at the post viral entry step and affect the triggering of fusion, as the SERMs\u2019 antiviral activity still can be observed in the absence of detectable estrogen receptor expression[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>].

Interestingly, different from the classical ESR1-related antiviral pathway, toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane by interacting with and destabilizing the virus membrane glycoprotein, and eventually inhibiting viral replication[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. As shown in Figure 5B, toremifene potentially affects several key host proteins associated with HCoV, such as RPL19, HNRNPA1, NPM1, EIF3I, EIF3F, and EIF3E[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>].

Irbesartan (Z = -5.98), a typical ARB, was approved by the FDA for treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Here, network proximity analysis shows a significant association between Irbesartan\u2019s targets and HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome. As shown in Figure 5C, irbesartan targets SLC10A1, encoding the sodium/bile acid cotransporter (NTCP) protein that has been identified as a functional preS1-specific receptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Irbesartan can inhibit NTCP, thus inhibiting viral entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>].

Sirolimus (Z = -2.35 and GSEA score = 3), an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was reported to effectively block viral protein expression and virion release effectively[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. Indeed, the latest study revealed the clinical application: sirolimus reduced MERS-CoV infection by over 60%[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. Moreover, sirolimus usage in managing patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure can improve those patients\u2019 prognosis significantly[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. Mercaptopurine (Z = -2.44 and GSEA score = 1), an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant property, has been used to treat cancer since the 1950s and expanded its application to several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Crohn\u2019s disease[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>].

As a biogenic amine, melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (Z = 1.72 and GSEA score = 2) plays a key role in various biological processes, and offers a potential strategy in the management of viral infections[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>]. Viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on multiple organ functions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>]. The antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients\u2019 clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. In addition, the application of melatonin may prolong patients\u2019 survival time, which may provide a chance for patients\u2019 immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Figure 5E, melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (Z = -1.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin. By inhibiting mast-cellderived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis, eplerenone can improve survival of mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>].",

            "In this study, we presented a network-based methodology for systematic identification of putative repurposable drugs and drug combinations for potential treatment of HCoV. Integration of drug-target networks, HCoV-host interactions, HCoV-induced transcriptome in human cell lines, and human protein-protein interactome network are essential for such identification. Based on comprehensive evaluation, we prioritized 16 putative repurposable drugs (Figure 5) and 3 putative drug combinations (Figure 6) for the potential treatment of HCoVs, including 2019-nCoV. However, all network-predicted repurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in preclinical models and randomized clinical trials before being used in patients.",
            "We acknowledge several limitations in our current study. In this study, we used a low binding affinity value of 10 \u03bcM as a threshold to define a physical drug-target interaction. However, a stronger binding affinity threshold (e.g., 1\u03bcM) may be a more suitable cut-off in drug discovery, although it will generate a smaller drug-target network. Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large-scale, experimentally reported drug-target networks from publicly available databases, the network data may be incomplete and some drug-protein interactions may be functional associations, instead of physical bindings. We may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>]. In addition, the collected virus-host interactions are far from complete and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may computationally predict a new virus-host interactome for HCoVs using sequence-based and structure-based approaches[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>]. The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic antiviral effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virushost interactions. Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>], as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions (including antagonists versus agonists). Comprehensive identification of the virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV, with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>], will significantly improve the accuracy of current network-based methodologies.",
            "Owing to lack of the complete drug target information (such as the molecular \u2018promiscuity\u2019 of drugs), the dose-response and dose-toxicity effects for both repurposable drugs and drug combinations cannot be identified in current network models. For example, Mesalazine, an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease, is a top network-predicted candidate drug (Figure 5A) associated with HCoVs. Yet, several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities (including pneumonia) associated with mesalazine usage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>]. Preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Furthermore, we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. However, we expect that our methodology reminds to be a useful network-based tools for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs\u2019 targets with the HCoV-host subnetwork in the human interactome. Finally, we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting nCoV host proteins only. Thus, our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only. Thus, combination of the existing anti-virus drugs (such as remdesivir[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]) with the networkpredicted repurposable drugs (Figure 5) or drug combinations (Figure 6) may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework.",
            "In conclusion, this study offers a powerful, integrated network-based systems pharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drug combinations for the potential treatment of HCoV. Our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-nCoV outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other types of virus and human diseases as well."
