        "abstract": "ABSTRACTEffective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses. However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYWe identified potential targets for immune responses to 2019-nCoV and provide essential information for understanding human immune responses to this virus and evaluation of diagnostic and vaccine candidates.",

        "author_conclusions": [
            "In conclusion, the use of available information related to SARS-CoV epitopes in conjunction with bionformatic predictions points to specific regions of 2019-nCoV which have a high likelihood of being recognized by human immune responses*. The observation that many B and T cell epitopes are highly conserved between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV is important. Protein regions that are conserved across relatively long evolutionary distances suggest that they are structurally or functionally constrained. Vaccination strategies designed to target the immune response toward these conserved epitope regions could generate immunity that is not only crossprotective across Betacoronaviruses but also relatively resistant to ongoing virus evolution."

The consensus protein sequences of each virus group were determined from the final alignments using the Sequence Variation Analysis tool in ViPR. Protein sequences from natural virus isolates with sequences identical to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV consensus were selected for use in epitope sequence analysis.",

            "Bcell epitope prediction on 2019-nCoV isolate Linear B cell epitope predictions were carried out on three different coronavirus proteins: surface glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and membrane glycoprotein (M) (IDs: YP_009724390.1, YP_009724397.2 and YP_009724393.1, respectively) as the homologous versions of these proteins are the primary targets of B cell immune responses for SARS-CoV. We used the BebiPred 2.0[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] algorithm embedded in the B cell prediction analysis tool available in IEDB [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. For each protein, the epitope probability score for each amino acid and the probability of exposure was retrieved. Potential B cell epitopes were predicted using a cutoff of 0.55 (corresponding to specificity greater than 0.81 and sensitivity below 0.3) and considering sequences having more than 7 amino acid residues. Structure-based antibody prediction was performed by using Discotope 2.0 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], available in IEDB [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and a positivity cutoff greater than -2.5 was applied (corresponding to specificity greater than or equal to 0.80 and sensitivity below 0.39). Since no PDB structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for the three 2019-nCoV proteins, a homology modeling approach was applied using SWISS-MODEL [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Of the three proteins analyzed, only surface glycoprotein (S) had a PDB template that covered 0.93 of the entire protein based on the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6ACD) with a GMQE score of 0.72 and a QMEAN of -4.08; as such, it was the only model used for the structure-based B cell prediction. Additional information regarding the surface glycoprotein 2019-nCoV model are available in the SWISS-MODEL report (Supplementary Fig S1).",

            "For CD4 T cell epitope prediction, we applied a previously described algorithm that was developed to predict dominant HLA class II epitopes, using a median consensus percentile of prediction cutoff \u226420 as recommended [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. For CD8 T cell epitope prediction, we selected the most frequent HLA class I alleles in the worldwide population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], using a phenotypic frequency cutoff \u2265 6%. The specific alleles included were: HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*23:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*44:02, HLA-B*44:03. The 2019-nCoV protein sequences were run against this set of alleles using the NetMHCpan EL 4.0 algorithm and a size range of 8-14mers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. For each HLA class I allele analyzed, we selected the top 1% epitopes ranked based on prediction score. To generate a final set for synthesis, duplicate peptides (i.e., those selected for multiple alleles) were reduced to a single occurance, and nested peptides were ensconced within longer sequences, up to 14 residues in length, before assigning the multiple corresponding HLA restrictions for each region.

            "In the context of B cell responses, most of the 12 antigens in the SARS-CoV proteome are associated with epitopes, with the greatest number derived from spike glycoprotein, nucleoprotein and membrane protein (Table 1C).",
            "The authors aligned the SARS-CoV T cell epitope sequences and calculated for each epitope the percentage identity to 2019-nCoV."

        "Results": [
            "B cell epitope predictions were carried out using the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and membrane glycoprotein sequences, which, as described above, were found to be the main protein targets for B cell responses to other coronaviruses.",
            "A full list of B cell epitope prediction results per amino acid position per protein is provided in Table S1.",
            "To predict conformational B cell epitopes, the authors used SWISS-Model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] and a SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein structure (PDB ID: 6ACD) to map the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein.",
            "A list of amino acid positions having a high probability of being included in predicted B cell epitopes for the surface glycoprotein, based on analysis with the Discotope 2.0 algorithm, are shown in Table S1.",
            "The authors first compared B cell immunodominant regions identified in SARS-CoV, and mapped to the homologous 2019-nCOV",
            "Out of the five B cell immunodominant regions from the SARS spike glycoprotein that were mapped to 2019-nCOV, three regions overlapped with those identified by BebiPred 2.0, and one overlapped with the 809-812 region predicted by Discotope 2.0 (Table S1 and Fig 3).",
