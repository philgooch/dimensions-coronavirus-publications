        "abstract": "Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID- 19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.\nMethod: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty.\nFindings: We estimated that R_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.\nInterpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.\nKeywords: Coronavirus, COVID-19, transmissibility, dynamic reproduction number R, statistical modelling, pneumonia outbreak",

            "In early December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, emerged into the human population in Wuhan, the pandemic center, China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The number of SARS-COV-2 infected pneumonia (COVID19) cases has increased rapidly since then in Wuhan. On January 19, 2020, the first case reported in another province was a person who traveled from<br/><br/>Wuhan. From January 23, 2020, a series of substantial public health interventions including travel bans into and from Wuhan, social isolation, quarantine and wearing face masks, have been implemented in Wuhan and subsequently other cities in China such as all 9 localities have successively launched the first-level response to major public health emergencies. As of February 20<br/><br/>(at the time of writing), there have been 75,567 confirmed cases and the death toll stands at 2239 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), 2-fold greater than what was reported ten days ago, and greatly surpasses the infections and tolls from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003.<br/><br/>For early assessment of the epidemic potential of COVID-19 outbreak and potential effects of government and public health intervention, it is essential to quantify the epidemiological parameters in real-time from a time series data. Using the earlier phase of outbreak data, the basic reproduction number R0 has been estimated to be somewhere between 2.2 to 4.0 in author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity."

Since we are most interested in the temporal trend after January 20, the underreporting might not vary greatly with time since then. Second, as there is a series of interventions implemented during subsequent periods, we were not able to distinguish which intervention could be the main driver based on current data. Third, due to the changes in diagnosis, the diagnosed cases increased dramatically up to 14840 in Wuhan and Hubei from February 12, which makes our prediction challenging. Thus we did not provide the predicted cases for Wuhan and Hubei province after February 13, 2020."

From January 23, 2020, a series of substantial public health interventions including travel bans into and from Wuhan, social isolation, quarantine and wearing face masks, have been implemented in Wuhan and subsequently other cities in China such as all 9 localities have successively launched the first-level response to major public health emergencies.

Beijing and Sichuan had the lowest transmission rates (ranging from 0.58 to 0.65), and Heilongjiang, Jilin and Tianjin had the lowest underlying cases but high transmission rates (0.83 to 0.98).",
            "This could be related to the extent of efforts in each province to reduce the number of contacts in the transmission process, particularly challenging for those with the highest number of cases. It was reported a high sensitivity of the timing of implementation of control for SARS, a 1-week delay in imple16",

            "February 19 to 24, and in Wuhan one week later. The model fitting to the data performed very well for all regions as shown by the observed cases generally falling in the 95% CI of the bound of prediction in the plots. Zhejiang and",
            "Guizhou provinces showed statistical anomalies with the largest predictor error (Supplementary Figure 3); the observed cases were either underestimated or overestimated. This could be due to the variation in the duration of the infectious period or the number of underlying case estimation at baseline as the transport data we have might not be completed, which warrant further investigation.",

Studies, for example, used serial interval estimates based on previous estimations of SARSCov[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. It would be desirable to estimate them from the model itself.",

Our method relies on the inference of transmission among the underlying statistical distribution of the infected cases during the infectious period. It can be used to provide statistical expectations for new case predictions. Large time-series data permit us to estimate the rates on a daily basis. Thus, for the calculations in this study, we choose to use a minimal statistical approach for emerging infectious diseases which is more appropriate and generalizable.",
            "Our study is not without limitations. First, our results are based on the diagnosis cases reported by the CDC in China. Underreporting is likely to occur which was not accounted for in our analysis. Among all cases reported until February 11, only 13.8% cases were reported prior January 20, 2020 and among them, 77.6% were among the Hubei province[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Since we are most interested in the temporal trend after January 20, the underreporting might not vary greatly with time since then. Second, as there is a series of interventions implemented during subsequent periods, we were not able to distinguish which intervention could be the main driver based on current data. Third, due to the changes in diagnosis, the diagnosed cases increased dramatically up to 14840 in Wuhan and Hubei from February 12, which makes our prediction challenging. Thus we did not provide the predicted cases for Wuhan and Hubei province after February 13, 2020.",
            "In summary, we provide transmission dynamic patterns of the COVID19 outbreak using time-serial data from January 20 to February 13, 2020 in",
            "China. The declining trend of Rt , as well as ratio for transmission rates, indicate the effects of public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. Model prediction results suggested that COVID-19 would be contained in provinces around 19 to 24 February, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan."

            "In early December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, emerged into the human population in Wuhan, the pandemic center, China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
            "The authors provide a real-time model-based analysis to estimate trends in transmissibility of COVID-19 from January 20 to February 13 in Wuhan, Hubei and other 28 provinces in China and forecast the turning point to reach a potential outbreak plateau based on the surveillance case counts as well as transportation and population immigration data from Wuhan to other cities."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Accumulated time on trains, on airplanes, highway mileage and population migration scales were used to model the underlying epidemic sizes in the provinces or cities outside Wuhan at the time 0 of this study which is on January 20, 2020.",
            "The optimal model with m \u201c 6 for 28 provinces and Wuhan and m \u201c 9 for author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
            "The duration of the infectious period m was 9 days, 3 days longer than that estimated in other provinces; this could be due to the delay in the diagnosis/hospital admission of infected cases in cities in Hubei.",
            "As the diagnosis criteria for Wuhan and Hubei province expanded to include those identified by clinic diagnosis since February 13, the reported cases increased dramatically since .",
            "Results from WuHan city and t2 being January 30 and m \u201c 6, the authors estimated the parameters based on t \u201c 1, \u0308 \u0308 \u0308 , T in Wuhan using the method displayed in Section 2.",
            "The authors described transmission dynamic patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak using time-serial data in Wuhan and 29 provinces in China from January 20 to February 13, 2020.",
            "The instantaneous Rt declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1, from January 21 to February 2 in Wuhan, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces.",
            "The authors did not provide the predicted cases for Wuhan and Hubei province after February 13, 2020."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "The declining trend of Rt , as well as ratio for transmission rates, indicate the effects of public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020.",
            "Model prediction results suggested that COVID-19 would be contained in provinces around 19 to 24 February, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan."
