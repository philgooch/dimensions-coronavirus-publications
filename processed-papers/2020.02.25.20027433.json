        "abstract": "To provide convenient access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak, we developed an R package, nCov2019 (https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019). Besides detailed real-time statistics, it offers access to three data sources with detailed daily statistics from December 1, 2019, for 43 countries and more than 500 Chinese cities. We also developed a web app (http://www.bcloud.org/e/) with interactive plots and simple time-series forecasts. These analytics tools could be useful in informing the public and studying how this and similar viruses spread in populous countries.",

            "As demonstrated in Suppl. Doc. 1, this new package also contains functionalities to facilitate data visualization. For example, with one command, users can easily plot the distribution of cases on the maps of the world, China, and even individual provinces (Figure 1). With historical data, we can incorporate temporal and spatial information to create an animation to help us understand disease transmission and examine the spread of the COVID19 outbreak.",
            "To enable users to access these datasets without coding, we also developed interactive web apps in both English [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and Chinese [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. As demonstrated in Supp. Doc. 1, these apps can also be run locally from Rstudio. Using these apps, users can gain insights by quickly generating all 23 plots in Supp. Doc. 2 based on daily updated data. Complementing the dashboard by Dong et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], our web app enables users to select their regions of interest and check both the historical and real-time data. Generated by the app on February 25, 2020, Figure 2 shows that the total confirmed cases in the provinces outside Hubei are stabilizing, following a similar trend. The extreme measures that the Chinese government took since January 23 seem to be working."
