        "abstract": "BackgroundThe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) has spread more rapidly than any other betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear.MethodsWe collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses.ResultsSystematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site.ConclusionsOur studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion.One Sentence SummaryNovel 2019-nCoV sequences revealed the evolution and specificity of betacoronavirus with possible mechanisms of enhanced infectivity.",

In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site.",
            "The first cases of human-to-human 2019-nCoV infection occurred mid-December<br/><br/>2019, To date, the total confirmed cases and confirmed death surpassed SARS by a magnitude within a shorter period of time[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. In an attempt to associate the pathologic property of 2019-nCoV with specific virulence factor, we compared the epidemiological information with sequencing data obtained from the WHO2. We compared the rate of infection for 2019-nCoV to that of the most recent betacoronavirus outbreaks, SARS in<br/><br/>November 2002 and MERS in September 2012 (Fig 1A.). 2019-nCoV appears to be transmitted much more quickly than SARS and MERS. To date, there are more confirmed<br/><br/>2019-nCoV cases than that of the whole 2002 SARS outbreak. Coronavirus sequences have been published frequently and consistently over the last 18 years, which included<br/><br/>SARS strains isolated from different countries during 2002 SARS outbreak, sporadic CoV strains mainly reported in China, MERS strains isolated from middle east countries such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (Fig 1B). To further understand the evolution of the betacoronaviruses and track the mutations accumulated with 2019-nCoV, we have collected and sequenced 11 full-length 2019-nCoV genome sequences from new patients identified in multiple Chinese cities including Wuhan (Fig 1C). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that 11 new strains of 2019-nCoV clustered together with other 2019-nCoV strains and were more homologous to the bat CoV RaTG13 strain than human SARS, MERS and other CoVs (Fig S1A). At the amino acid levels, they only had a few random substitutions at positions with consensus sequences identical to the corresponding amino acid sequences in human and bat SARS (Fig S1B)."

The current infection has spread outwards from China to 29 other countries or regions including South<br/><br/>Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>Series of pneumonia cases from Wuhan linked to this virus, with symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and dyspnea[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Most patients had no significant upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting that target cells are located lower in the airway. Consequently, the virus was isolated and sequenced from epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].<br/><br/>Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] that undergo rapid mutation and recombination[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], of its receptor binding domain (RBD) to adapt to a large pool of species[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].

        ],
        "discussion": [
            "The 2019-nCoV is still spreading rapidly from Wuhan to different cities in China and other countries, at a magnitude faster than SARS and MERS4. We have systematically analyzed and tracked the genome mutations among 120 different strains of 2019-nCoV. Although most substitutions are de novo mutations, we have identified multiple SNPs shared by different strains of 2019-nCoV. Due to the low mutation rate and large genome capital, we hypothesis that these shared mutations are inherited SNPs from large group of populations, likely transmitted from people to people. Based on this assumption, we have generated the SNP tree to track mutation and spread of 2019-<br/><br/>nCoV. Interestingly, the 2019-nCoV stains we have analyzed fall into two distinct groups with different nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 8782 and 28144. Although it remains to be determined if these two distinct groups of 2019-nCoV were evolved before or after transmission from animal to human, both groups were first detected in wuhan and then spread to different regions in China and multiple countries. By combining additional inheritable mutations in subsequent generations of 2019-nCoV with the times and locations of the patient sample collections, we can trace possible viral transmission pathways."

In an attempt to associate the pathologic property of 2019-nCoV with specific virulence factor, we compared the epidemiological information with sequencing data obtained from the WHO2.

To further understand the evolution of the betacoronaviruses and track the mutations accumulated with 2019-nCoV, we have collected and sequenced 11 full-length 2019-nCoV genome sequences from new patients identified in multiple Chinese cities including Wuhan (Fig 1C). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that 11 new strains of 2019-nCoV clustered together with other 2019-nCoV strains and were more homologous to the bat CoV RaTG13 strain than human SARS, MERS and other CoVs (Fig S1A). At the amino acid levels, they only had a few random substitutions at positions with consensus sequences identical to the corresponding amino acid sequences in human and bat SARS (Fig S1B).",

Considering potential sequencing errors at both ends, the genome sequence variations among different strains of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients located in different cities were low considering only several mutations in about 30kb genome per isolate. Based on the nucleotide positions",
            "8517 and 27641, the 2019-nCoV strains can be divided into two major groups (Figs 2A and S2). All the group 1 strains have thymine at 8517 and cytosine at 27641, which are same as corresponding nucleotides in SARS, whereas the group 2 stains have cytosine at 8517 and thymine at 27641 (Figs 2A and S3).

Within each group, we also observed additional shared mutations added to multiple strains. Based on these potentially inheritable mutations and the identifying times and locations, we generated a mutation tree map to track individual shared mutations and show the relationships among different isolates (Fig 2A and S2). For example, five strains identified in Guangdong from Jan. 10-15 all share the same mutation in nucleotide position 28578 on the background of group 1 might be transmitted by the same person. The similar strain may transmit to three patients identified in Japan on Jan. 29-31 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 2397 and to a patient identified in USA on Jan. 22 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 10818. The G10818T is very interesting as it is shared by several independent strains in both group 1 and group 2, which will lead to L3606F amino acid substitution within the orf1ab polyprotein (Fig S3). It is not clear if the common mutation both in group 1 and group 2 strains at 10818 site has any growth advantage but pangolin and bat CoV have L3606V substitution at the same position (Fig S3).

The major difference between these two clades is that the RBM of the clade II viruses has regions with 5 and 13-14 amino acids shorter than that of the clade I viruses (Fig. 4B). Previous structural analysis have demonstrated that the 13-14 amino acid region of the SARS RBM forms a distinct loop structure, which is stabilized with a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].

Interestingly, such an insertion (PRRA) within the spike protein of 2019-nCoV creates a potential cleavage site RRAR for the mammalian furin protein, which the consensus sequence is RXXR. The potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site is inserted at the boundary between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, and the first proline residue of the PRRA insertion may introduce a beta turn into the polypeptide chain. To understand the uniqueness of this insertion, we performed sequence comparison using represented SARS-CoV strains from human, civet and bat. Our study showed that this insertion is unique to the 2019-nCoV (Figure 4C and S6). When compared to other CoV family members, we found that similar insertion has been identified and are located in the structural boundary between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein (Figure 4C)."

            "Human SARS viruses are known to use the ACE2 while MERS use DPP4 as their receptors to infect host cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Recent studies have indicated ACE2 as the entry receptor for 2019-nCoV 29 although other host cell factors such as TMPRSS2 are likely involved 30. When we used the receptor binding motifs to conduct phylogenic analysis, we could separate 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS into two distinct clades.",
            "Interestingly, all the viruses known to use ACE2 as the entry receptor are within the clade",
            "I whereas all the bat SARS viruses which do not use ACE2 entry receptors belong to clade II. Therefore, we predict that the clade I CoV viruses including the 2019-nCoV can while clade II CoV cannot infect host cells through ACE2. Based on the available genome sequences, there are many more clade II bat CoV (over 49 stains) than clade I bat CoV (about 12 strains). Some of the clade II bat CoV such as ZXC21 and ZC45 are more homologous to the 2019-nCoV than the clade I bat CoV and human SARS. It would be interesting to find out if homologous betacoronavirus can switch tropism through recombination in the RBM.",
            "We have also identified a unique four amino acid (PRRA) insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which may function as a furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site. It has been shown that CoV may undergo a protease cleavage to trigger the viruscell membrane fusion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. This flexibility in priming and triggering the fusion machinery greatly modulates the viral pathogenicity and tropism of different coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",
            "However, such protease cleavage has not been detected in SARS-CoV19. Introducing a cleavage site into SARS-CoV resulted in spike protein cleavage and potentiated the membrane fusion activity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. In addition, introducing a cleaved spike protein into a SARS-",
            "CoV pseudotype virus allowed it to directly enter host cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Based on previous sequencing and structural analysis, the 2019-nCoV spike protein were predicted to interact with the ACE2 receptor to trigger the fusion with the host cell membrane and initiate infection 29. Therefore, mutations or indels altering the S1-S2 subunits should significantly impact viral infection. We hypothesize that the PRRA insertion may render the spike protein to cleavage process, which triggers the viral fusion event.",
            "Although the exact mechanisms responsible for such a high infection rates remains to be further investigated, our data on both recombination in the RBD and the unique furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site insertion between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein may explain why the transmission of this newly emerged virus is significantly increased compared to the related beta-coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS. Further tracking the genome mutations with additional strains of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients in different locations at different time points will provide insights to understand the molecular evolution of this rapid spreading viruses. More importantly, comparison of protein sequence and structural differences between 2019-nCoV and other beta coronaviruses will provide insights to rapidly develop novel strategies to treat or prevent diseases associated with the novel emerging infectious viruses."
