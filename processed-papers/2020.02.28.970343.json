        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Till date, no vaccine or completely effective drug is available for the cure of COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is needed to be design. This study was conducted to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as a target and epitopes (B cell, IFN-\u03b3 and T cell) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected T cell epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the world\u2019s population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and twelve MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the vaccine. The allergenicity, physiochemical properties, antigenicity and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic and antigenic. Molecular docking demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed vaccine needs to be experimentally validated.",

MEV was basic, according to the theoretical pI value, which can ensure stable physiological pH interaction. The calculated aliphatic index and instability index scores showed that the vaccine protein may be stable and thermostable. Positive score of grand average of hydropathy suggests its hydrophobic nature. MEV was found to be highly antigenic, immunogenic and non-allergenic indicating an epitope vaccine\u2019s potential to cause robust immune responses without any allergic reactions. The effectiveness of MEV depends on the population in which the vaccine is used. T cell epitopes included in the MEV showed 99.29% of the world\u2019s population, indicating that the vaccine developed would be effective for most of the world population. The strong binding affinity of the vaccine with immune receptor (TLR3 & TLR8) is necessary to effectively transport vaccine into the body. For this purpose, docking between the TLR3, TLR8 and MEV was performed. The translation efficiency of foreign genes within the host system differs due to the incompatibility of mRNA codons, which require codon optimization for higher expression 31. CAI value obtained was 1.0 and GC content 55.51% was also within the optimum limit indicating possible higher expression within E. coli K-12 system. Thus, MEV designed with caution using such a methodology could become an integral asset in the fight against tumors and viral contaminations.
