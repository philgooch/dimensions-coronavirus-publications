Meanwhile, the earliest confirmed case appeared on<br/><br/>December 8 and there was no history of contact with the Huanan Seafood Market. Therefore, based on the average incubation stage of 5.2 days (the incubation stage for 95% of confirmed patients is about 12.5 days), the situation of human-to-human transmission took place from mid-December. The specific time can not be estimated. As a result, we assume that the outbreak started on December 10. At present, no satisfactory parameter evidence has been found with respect to the confirmed rate \u03c1 of suspected cases. Based on the historical data of new suspected cases on the t day and new confirmed cases on the t + 1 day (it takes 10-12 hours for the current detection technology to get results), and based on the Yang\u2019s retrospect study of 8,866 cases, the confirmed rate of suspected cases is about 46% (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2020_a\">Yang et al.,2020</a>).

            "In this paper, the scale of 2019-nCov infection is simulated and estimated according to the time line of the epidemic at different times based on the methodology of infection dynamics of population topology network. We use historical data and SEIR model for important parameters assumption and these parameters are fitted in simulated infection network. Furthermore, migration data are also used to estimate the area outside Wuhan (Guangzhou is selected here) which could also be regarded as cross-validation materials. The model reproduces a relative comprehensive progression of the infection development in Wuhan, which shows the \u201cgolden control window\u201d and a sharp rising of infection scale with time points. And the model also performs well on scale estimation especially in Guangzhou: we estimate the imported cases from Wuhan of Guangzhou is 170 (95%CI: 161.27-179.26) while the number from authority is 168, and we estimated the total infection scale of Guangzhou on Jan 24 is 315 (95%CI: 109.20-520.79) and 339 cases were confirmed in Guangzhou on Feb 18 according to the report of Health Commission of Guangzhou.

            "Many complex systems in the real world can be represented in the form of networks. For example, if a person is regarded as a node in the network, then the connection between people can be considered as an edge connecting nodes. That is a way which a social relationship network can be constructed in. Similarly, in epidemiology, individuals are nodes, and the contacts of individuals can be seen as edges. Moreover, the state of individual (such as susceptibility, exposure, and infection) can be added to nodes as additional information. As a result, an epidemiological network topology graph can be constructed with these elements. One of the most important parameters is the probability of contact between people. For example, a person living in the city (work, transportation, dining) may need to contact dozens of people in close range, and indirectly contact hundreds or even thousands (such as in the subway environment) in one day. If we assume that an individual contacts 1,000 people in Guangzhou every day, therefore, the probability of contact is 10/1.5\u00d7107. This contact probability can be regarded as the generation probability of edges between nodes. We generate random network topology graphs by using the parameters mentioned above for presenting relationships among the crowd intuitively (Figure 1). The results of population isolation caused by quarantine measures for epidemic control are very similar with it. Therefore, we can generate a network topology graph based on the timeline of the epidemic in subsequent simulations by considering the contact situation of the crowd, which can reflect different situations more realistically.",
            "According to the existing data, the overall time line of the NCP epidemic situation is sorted out. The purpose of that is to re-evaluate the important parameters of the model in different periods of time, so as to simulate the real situation as much as possible and make the prediction model more accurate. There are two important parameters that will be adjusted in different periods. The first one is contact rate(C). The second one is the propagation risk which could be directly adjusted by using the beta value mentioned above. The time period can be divided into four parts: early breakout, development, spread and disease control stage. Due to the situation in Wuhan is relatively special, medical resources and suppliers were relative shortage within one week after quarantine. Fortunately, this situation was relieved by lager scale aiding after Feb 1. Considering that there may be a certain concentration in the hospital area, the contact rate may be higher than other areas.",
            "Scale estimation in Wuhan 1. Early breakout, development and spread stage in Wuhan",
            "An important parameter which should be taken into consideration is that how many actually infected people were at the start of the outbreak on December 10. According to Li \u2019study, the number of confirmed cases as of December 10 was 7, while the number of confirmed cases as of December 31 was 47. If the maximum incubation period was 14 days, the actual number of infected cases on December 15 was close to 50. Besides, we assume that the contact rate C is 0.0001 as baseline, and infectivity was not excluded within the incubation period, and other parameters are the same with the analysis above. The estimation (Figure 3) shows that the number of infections experienced an increase since the end of December, and the number of new exposed had been accumulating until January 10, which led to the subsequent large scale of outbreak. In addition to considering the Spring Festival travel, this simulation is more in line with the argument that the \"golden window period\" of controlling the epidemic situation is before January 10. And after 18th the infection scale underwent a sharp increase. The number of infections estimated on January 25 is showed as follows. The overall infection rate is about 0.684% and the 95% CI is 0.648%-0.721%. Because of the overall population of Wuhan during the Spring Festival is in a dynamic state, 9 million population as baseline is assumed. The number of infections is about 61,596, and the 95% CI is from 58,344.02 to 64,847.98."

            "During the 1st week after the closure of the city in Wuhan, relative shortage of medical resources and crowd shopping for supplies may induce gathering and cross-infection. Therefore, the contact rate in Phrase A could be considered to be adjusted to 1/15 of the baseline, while the contagious probability is adjusted to 0.5 times the baseline. However, these situations would be relieved after the comprehensive aid and response, so the contact rate between people might drop to 1/30 of the baseline in phrase B, even lower. Nevertheless, under the strict control of the confirmed cases and suspected cases, the transmission efficiency could be going down in further. We assumed 70% confirmed cases and suspected cases were quarantined, and probability of infection also reduced to 25% of baseline by the personal protection. As a result, by the model\u2019s calculation, there would be about 3,375 new infections during phrase A and phrase B in Wuhan. The 95% CI is 2,611.31-4,138.69. From the estimations in different time periods showed above, the total infection scale in Wuhan is 64971, 95%CI 60,955.33-68,986.67.",
            "It\u2019s known that most of the confirmed cases in Non-Wuhan area had exposure history of Wuhan city, and new year migration had accelerated the spreading. We combine the migration data with the model and use Guangzhou city (provincial capital of Guangdong) as an example to: 1. Evaluate the estimation effect of combine model for Non-Wuhan area; 2. Make a cross validation for Wuhan estimation model, because Wuhan estimation results are used as baseline for combine model. According to Baidu migration data (Baidu's Migration Index) analysis, combined with",
            "Wuhan January 10, 2020 - January 24, 2020 migration index (city was blockaded on 23rd, but there were still people moving out of Wuhan according to the migration index even on",
            "24th), and the report that the number of people moved out before the 24th is about 5 million people, we can estimate the number of people moving out daily as Table 2. From January 10, 2020 to January 24, 2020, 24,893 people imported to Guangzhou from Wuhan. Based on the infection rate mentioned above, the estimated number of infections is approximately 170, and 95% CI is 161.27-179.26. Also, according to Baidu's migration index, Guangzhou's exported population was about 11.26 million from Jan 10. Guangzhou\u2019s population is 18 million with 9 million resident population (Guangzhou Statistic Bureau) and 9 million migrant population (Xiao et al.,2018). Therefore, the population base of Guangzhou after January 24 was about 7 million. According to the timeline, Guangzhou launched level 1 public health response on Jan 23, entered a tight control period and used various protective measures to block transmission. We assume that the contact rate is about 1/10 of the usual (baseline). After Guangzhou started a level 1 public health response, people from Wuhan are checked and asked for self-isolation. In other words, the maximum free movement time of the imported infected cases is 14 days, the minimum is 0 day. By accumulating the free movement time, we could come to the result that the average time window of the activity of the imported infected people is less than 8 days (Table 2). With the assumption above, the total number of infections in Guangzhou after Jan 24 was 315, and 95% CI was 109.20-520.79. Because of the tight control and strict self-quarantine, 315 could be the total infection number."

        "Discussion": [
            "In this paper, the scale of 2019-nCov infection is simulated and estimated according to the time line of the epidemic at different times based on the methodology of infection dynamics of population topology network. We use historical data and SEIR model for important parameters assumption and these parameters are fitted in simulated infection network. Furthermore, migration data are also used to estimate the area outside Wuhan (Guangzhou is selected here) which could also be regarded as cross-validation materials. The model reproduces a relative comprehensive progression of the infection development in Wuhan, which shows the \u201cgolden control window\u201d and a sharp rising of infection scale with time points. And the model also performs well on scale estimation especially in Guangzhou: we estimate the imported cases from Wuhan of Guangzhou is 170 (95%CI: 161.27-179.26) while the number from authority is 168, and we estimated the total infection scale of Guangzhou on Jan 24 is 315 (95%CI: 109.20-520.79) and 339 cases were confirmed in Guangzhou on Feb 18 according to the report of Health Commission of Guangzhou. And it should be noted that the simulation of Guangzhou ia based on the infection scale estimation and the migration data of Wuhan.",
            "Our study shows that dynamic network model and dynamic parameter for different time periods are important to modelling, and challenge is also obvious for parameters\u2019 deduction. Further work should be done for adding more area data for validation especially in the territories outside the mainland of China."
