            "R0 is a widely used indicator of transmission potential in a totally susceptible population and is driven by the average contact rate and the mean infectious period of the disease (1). Yet, it only characterizes transmission potential at the onset of the epidemic and varies geographically for a given infectious disease according to local healthcare provision, outbreak response, as well as socioeconomic and cultural factors. Furthermore, estimating R0 requires information about the natural history of the infectious disease. Thus, our ability to estimate reproduction numbers for novel infectious diseases is hindered by the paucity of information about their epidemiological characteristics and transmission mechanisms. More informative metrics could synthesize real-time information about the extent to which the epidemic is expanding over time. Such metrics would be particularly useful if they rely on minimal data on the outbreak\u2019s trajectory (2)."
