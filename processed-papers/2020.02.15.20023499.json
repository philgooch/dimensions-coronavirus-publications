            "There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China.

            "The new coronavirus (COVID-19) appears to be fairly transmissible [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], and is spreading in China. Disease severity is a particularly important parameter for understanding this new disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], but unfortunately, the case fatality risk (CFR) data from China is difficult to interpret owing to likely missed mild cases (including due to a lack of appropriate test kits early in the epidemic) and also the likely delay in deaths occurring. Such a prolonged time course is suggested by a case series of 138 cases from Wuhan, China with cases enrolled between 1-28 January 2020. For this group on 3 February, 62% were still hospitalised and 31% (11/36) of those admitted to ICU were still there (6 had died) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",

            "Next we considered the typical survival of people admitted to ICUs with severe respiratory conditions.

This study found 374 hospital deaths in 1136 patients (32.9%) assigned to treatment with higher PEEP and 409 hospital deaths in 1163 patients (35.2%) assigned to lower PEEP (with no significant difference between these two groups). Combining these data suggests a CFR in such patients with acute lung injury of 34.1% (783/2299). This estimate is a little less than one case series of ICU patients with acute respiratory failure from Influenza A (H1N1) and requiring mechanical ventilation, who had a CFR of 46% (156/337) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Another study of such ICU patients with influenza found a lower overall CFR of 26% (492/1859) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] and another one reported a CFR of 24% (177/733) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Furthermore, in a group of 340 ICU patients with ARDS, the CFR at 90 days was 32% in a group given a neuromuscular blocker and 41% in the placebo group [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "We then applied the 34.1% value from the meta-analysis to the data in Table 1, giving an estimated CFR of 1.37% ([14 x 34.1%]/349) for COVID-19. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of this estimate is 0.57% to 3.22%. This estimate can be considered a symptomatic CFR (sCFR) as it likely to be based on a denominator who had symptoms and were tested and laboratory-confirmed as cases. This estimate is almost invariably higher than the infectionfatality risk (IFR) which can only be estimated when serological testing becomes available to identify all of those infected [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "Decision-makers and disease modellers might still be best to assume that the \u2018true\u2019 CFR is less than our estimate here as mild cases may not be identified. Furthermore, if a specific treatment is identified in the near future, then cases could have improved survival and the CFR might decline. On the other hand, if health systems became overloaded with the COVID-19 epidemic, then the CFR could likely increase for both the community and in hospital cases. As there is further progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, ongoing work will be needed to better clarify both transmissibility and the CFR, so that the likely mortality burden can be estimated. The method we have used here for CFR estimation will only be valid prior to healthcare systems becoming overloaded, after which they are likely to change their ICU admission policies.",
            "Our provisional CFR estimate for COVID-19 is less than that estimated for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is broadly comparable with two of the three previous influenza pandemics (when considering the range of estimated values) (Table 2).",
