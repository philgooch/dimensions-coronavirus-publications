The aged below 20 years that\naccounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were\naccounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all\nsevere groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P &lt;\n0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The\nrate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed\ntomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups\nwere 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range\nof overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P &lt; 0.01).\nLymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and\naspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were\nelevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of\noverall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients\nwere increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that\nin the non-severe group ( P &lt; 0.01 ).\nConclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower\nlymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for\nunfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in\nsevere COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may\nbe carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.",

The 2019-nCov is an betacoronavirus that possibly originated from wild animals that genome is highly homologous to bats 2. Human-to-human transmission is the main way of cause infection 3. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it to be a public health emergency of international concern 4. Until February 20, 2020, a total number of 75569 COVID-19 cases have been diagnosed in China, including 2239 deaths 5. Despite the rapid spread over the world, the clinical features and laboratory inspection of COVID-19 keep largely unclear. The clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19 cases were similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) that could occur acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and even death 6.Whereas the main clinical features of COVID-19 patients are fever, cough and sore throat. However, there are few reports on the clinical features and laboratory detection results of NCP cases in every regions of Hubei province outside Wuhan. We aimed to through analyzed 128 laboratory confirmed cases of Xiangyang No 1 Hospital to reveal the infectious characteristics of COVID-19 that provide more information for the research of novel coronavirus."

Until 16 February 2020, the number of COVID-19 patients was more than 70 000, yet the number of infections was still rising 5. However, there are still no effective treatment for COVID-19, the main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy to alleviate symptoms and maintain organ function in severe diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Although some studies have reported that some drugs can be used against the 2019-nCov, these drugs still in the research stage[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].<br/><br/>Our 128 case series by laboratory-diagnosed that all of them comeback from Wuhan, or had contacted with people from Wuhan, or close contacted with diagnosed patients. However, there are unavoidable misdiagnosis through laboratory- confirmed by real-time quantitative fluorescence PCR detection of 2019-nCov due to sampling deviation. In our study, the aged over 50 years patients accounted for over half of the diagnosed patients (53.9%). Fever (89.8%) and cough(67.2%) were common symptoms, yet sore throat (14.1%) was rare. Chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity of diagnosed patients account for 63.3%, whereas the severe pneumonia up to 76.2%, these were inconsistent with other studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Our data suggested that gender may not be an influence factor in 2019-nCov infection, yet advanced age was a risk factor for viral infection and poor prognosis. Our data of laboratory detection indicated that the white blood cells and C-reactive protein level were elevated in severe case series and the lymphocytes were decreased. The results suggested that severe pneumonia may be accompanying bacterial infection and immune deficiency may be also a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis in patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In addition, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and creatinine (CR) were elevated in the patients of severe pneumonia. The results suggested that 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function. In summary, our data provide more information that advanced age, lower lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function."

        "INTRODUCTION": [
            "Since December 2019, fast-multiplying outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) in China, which have reached multiple continents currently. 2019-nCov mainly cause pneumonia that the desease was named as novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) 1. The 2019-nCov is an betacoronavirus that possibly originated from wild animals that genome is highly homologous to bats 2. Human-to-human transmission is the main way of cause infection 3. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it to be a public health emergency of international concern 4. Until February 20, 2020, a total number of 75569 COVID-19 cases have been diagnosed in China, including 2239 deaths 5. Despite the rapid spread over the world, the clinical features and laboratory inspection of COVID-19 keep largely unclear. The clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19 cases were similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) that could occur acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and even death 6.Whereas the main clinical features of COVID-19 patients are fever, cough and sore throat. However, there are few reports on the clinical features and laboratory detection results of NCP cases in every regions of Hubei province outside Wuhan. We aimed to through analyzed 128 laboratory confirmed cases of Xiangyang No 1 Hospital to reveal the infectious characteristics of COVID-19 that provide more information for the research of novel coronavirus."

Clinical data were collected from the hospital electronic medical records system and laboratory information system. On admission, 107 and 21 patients were divided into non-severe and severe groups, respectively. A confirmed case with COVID-19 was defined as a positive result to real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens 7. Only the laboratory-confirmed cases were included the analysis. Suspected patients and clinical diagnosised patients were not part of our study. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Xiangyang No 1Hospital with written informed consent from the patients. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The data between groups with variables were compared by \u03c72 test or Fisher's exact test, and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. All means were reported with the corresponding standard deviation in tables. The P values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant."

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "2019 novel coronavirus was an batacoronavirus which was transmitted by droplets and direct contact with a patient\u2019s body fluids, other ways of it transmission was unclear[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Until 16 February 2020, the number of COVID-19 patients was more than 70 000, yet the number of infections was still rising 5. However, there are still no effective treatment for COVID-19, the main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy to alleviate symptoms and maintain organ function in severe diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Although some studies have reported that some drugs can be used against the 2019-nCov, these drugs still in the research stage[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",
            "Our 128 case series by laboratory-diagnosed that all of them comeback from Wuhan, or had contacted with people from Wuhan, or close contacted with diagnosed patients. However, there are unavoidable misdiagnosis through laboratory- confirmed by real-time quantitative fluorescence PCR detection of 2019-nCov due to sampling deviation. In our study, the aged over 50 years patients accounted for over half of the diagnosed patients (53.9%). Fever (89.8%) and cough(67.2%) were common symptoms, yet sore throat (14.1%) was rare. Chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity of diagnosed patients account for 63.3%, whereas the severe pneumonia up to 76.2%, these were inconsistent with other studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Our data suggested that gender may not be an influence factor in 2019-nCov infection, yet advanced age was a risk factor for viral infection and poor prognosis. Our data of laboratory detection indicated that the white blood cells and C-reactive protein level were elevated in severe case series and the lymphocytes were decreased. The results suggested that severe pneumonia may be accompanying bacterial infection and immune deficiency may be also a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis in patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In addition, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and creatinine (CR) were elevated in the patients of severe pneumonia. The results suggested that 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function. In summary, our data provide more information that advanced age, lower lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function."
