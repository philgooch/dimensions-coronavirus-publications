        "abstract": "The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effectiveness of consultations and remote patient monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and prevention education and training.",

            "Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. Implementation of the telemedicine system is supported by grants from the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Headquarters (NCPPCH) and the Finance Department of Henan Province. A subsidy of 10 million Chinese yuan has been allocated to the construction and operation of ETCS. Collaborating with China Mobile and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., on January 29, 2020 the NTCC sent 18 workgroups to isolation wards to set up telemedicine networks and equipment. The total round-trip distance we travelled was about 9,320 miles, via box trucks, while the approximate round-trip distance to the farthest hospital from the NTCC headquarters in Zhengzhou was 743 miles. Based on our previous experience of building 5G networks and smart medical terminals, 126 network hospitals were successfully connected to the NTCC on ETCS within 82 hours.",
            "ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer, as depicted in Figure 1. The telemedicine service platform layer enables a specialist treatment team of provincial specialists to conquer distance and provide access to clinicians working in the regional hospitals. It provides clinicians and patients with immediate diagnosis and consultations regarding COVID-19, wireless remote patient monitoring, remote multiple disciplinary care, and telehealth for education and training, utilizing interactive live video conferencing. The specialist treatment team members work closely with the NCPPCH and Health Commission of Henan Province to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. The telemedicine cloud layer allows clinicians to capture, store and process patient medical records, and to achieve real-time data exchange. In addition, prevention and treatment guidelines, and guidance on drug use and management of coronavirus patients can be accessed via the telemedicine cloud. The telemedicine service application layer involves 2 provincial-level hospitals, 18 municipal hospitals and 106 county-level hospitals, which can obtain consultations from the specialist treatment team. This logical structure supports a system of telemedicine clinical management to combat the COVID-19 outbreak."
