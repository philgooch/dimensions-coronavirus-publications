The exposed and the infected peak at certain time and the recovered increases during the same time of period, which is consistent with observations and other models in the literature.<br/><br/>Since k1 and k4 are functions of virus particle volume fraction and environment temperature, the fraction in each category should change with these two parameters, too. Besides virus particle volume fraction and temperature related terms in Eq 2 and Eq 3 , the remaining is related to virus particle radius and mass, and the spacial volume under consideration. Clearly, large virus particle size and mass lead to large rate constants.

        "discussion": [
            "Disease transmission is difficult to describe, as it is hard to identify the sources of diseases, confirm infected individuals, predict human movement pattern and virus particles transmission pattern, etc. The physical mechanisms and principles governing infectious disease transmissions should be similar to the observed in amorphous disorder systems, such as the percolation transition, Boltzmann distribution probability, the stretched exponential relaxation, etc. Human motion is not a thermal driven movement, however, has been found to follow the same Boltzmann distribution probability. The volume fraction of virus particles should lead to a dramatic increase in transmission rate, similar to percolation transition process. The common many-body problems encountered in chemistry and physics world can be resolved with the integration of Eyring\u2019s rate process theory and free volume concept, which has been demonstrated to work well for many multi-scale systems ranging from electrons to granular particles, even the universe[41]. This approach is therefore naturally applied to the disease transmissions. Attempt made in this article is to understand physical mechanisms of infectious disease transmissions using same categorical methods popularly employed in infectious disease transmission field. Although our focus is put on coronavirus (Covid-19) currently spreading around the world, the theoretical framework proposed in this article can be applied to other transmission diseases, too."
        ],
        "conclusion": [
            "A sequential chemical reaction process from the susceptible, to the exposed, the infected, and the removed in the end is proposed to describe disease transmissions. At each step, there is a chemical rate constant associated with and the fraction of each product/reactant can be easily calculated. Every step is a one-way reaction, except the last step from the infected to the removed, as some small amount of the removed could be infected again. The Eyring\u2019s rate process theory and free volume concept continue to be used for defining rate constants.<br/><br/>In general, our model predicts that the fraction of the infected will peak at certain time, increase with the volume fraction of virus particles, and decrease with temperature. The energy barrier for human to move has played a critical role in disease transmissions. The isolation process with a huge energy barrier for human can change the chemical reaction rate constant dramatically. The basic reproduction number is not a constant and can be computed once the parameters in the models are determined."

            "Infectious diseases occur frequently within last twenty years. The 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), 2009 influenza A (H1N 1), 2013 ebola virus, and current coronavirus inflected pneumonia (Covid \u2212 19) are among the deadliest and have posed a strong impact on human lives and activities. Mathematical modeling and analysis of infectious disease transmissions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] have been performed for a century.

The problems encountered in disease transmission area are similar to many-body problems encountered in chemistry and physics fields, where many entities like electrons, atoms, molecules, or nano-sized even micro-sized particles interact each other in a disordered manner.",
            "The Eyring\u2019 rate process theory[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] and free volume concept[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] have been employed to solve many-body problems without involving complicated quantum mechanical calculations. The Eyring\u2019s rate process theory, originated from quantum mechanics, argues that every physical or chemical phenomenon is a rate controlled process, such as chemical reactions, electron transfer, conductivity, viscous flows, diffusions, etc. Every process needs an activated energy to move from the initial state to the final state. Free volume theory, originated from molecular systems, is a most successful mean field theory in dealing with many-body problems. All different kinds of interactions among entities are factored into a single term, the free volume available in a system. Since the free volume theory resolves how large freedom an entity may have and the Eyring\u2019s rate process theory describes how fast the process is, these two theories have been integrated together to describe many seemingly unrelated systems or phenomena like glass liquids[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], colloids and polymers[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], granules[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], electrical and proton conductivity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], superconductivity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], and Hall Effect[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] with great success.",
            "In this article, we will utilize the Eyring\u2019s rate process theory and free volume concept to describe infectious disease transmission process. The infectious disease transmission is considered as a sequential chemical reaction. We will follow the popular SIR (susceptible, inf ectious, and removed) and SEIR (susceptible, exposed, inf ectious, and removed) compartment categorization methods proposed in the literature[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] to develop our theory.

            "SEIR models, we will call our modified versions as MSIR and MSEIR in this article. The key is how to theoretically determine chemical reaction rate constants like k1, k2, k2, k3, k4, k5, k5 expressed in two chemical reactions shown above. Once these parameters are known, the fractions of S, E, I, R can be predicted. The first step in MSIR model and the second and third steps in MSEIR model are one way irreversible chemical reactions. The last step in both MSIR and MSEIR models are reversible. Note that both k2 and k5 should be very small and the initial fraction of the recovered should be small too, leading to a negligible contribution to the infected pool.",

            "This individual thus becomes \u201cinfected\u201d. So in MSIR model, there should be two steps involved during the process from \u201dS\u201d to \u201dI\u201d: the individual movement and virus particle",
            "movement. Human movement is a stochastic random process and should be similar to the movements of atoms, molecules, colloidal particles, and even granular powders, which have been studied extensively. Someone may argue that human movement is an athermal process, while atomic, molecular, and colloidal particle movements are thermal driven. For athermal granular powder under a tapping process, we theoretically found that they behave like thermal systems and follow the stretched exponential pattern in term of tap density changing with the number of taps[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Our approach is mainly based on Theodor Forster\u2019s theory[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] that deals with the energy transfer from donors to random distributed acceptors.",
            "Theodor Forster\u2019s theory involves a very complicated quantum mechanical treatment but its mathematical backbone was simplified and extracted by Blumen[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] and Klasfter[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Detailed information can be found in my previous article[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Furthermore, human collective motion and individual walking behaviors of animals were found to behave like thermal systems and follow Boltzmann distribution, though the temperature needs to be defined differently in these athermal systems[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Utilizing the same approach to treat \u201chuman movements\u201d in disease transmissions, we may write the reaction constant as[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]: k3",

It should be similar to the viscosity or conductivity of an entity that has been addressed in many systems in my previous articles[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>].

For infectious diseases, more free volume for both human and virus particles means \u201cisolation\u201d and less transmission. High virus particle volume fractions mean higher transmissions, which is similar to viscosity of colloidal suspensions or granular powders. Therefore the chemical reaction rate should be proportional to the \u201cviscosity\u201d of this entity, then k4 can be written as[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]: k4",

We then can predict the peak time, the peak infected, and the basic reproduction number, etc."

            "The fractions of the susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered can be computed as a function of time based on the equations above and shown in Figure 1 for both MSIR and MSEIR models. The exposed and the infected peak at certain time and the recovered increases during the same time of period, which is consistent with observations and other models in the literature.",
            "Since k1 and k4 are functions of virus particle volume fraction and environment temperature, the fraction in each category should change with these two parameters, too. Besides virus particle volume fraction and temperature related terms in Eq 2 and Eq 3 , the remaining is related to virus particle radius and mass, and the spacial volume under consideration. Clearly, large virus particle size and mass lead to large rate constants. For clearly showing the relationship between rate constants and virus particle volume fraction and temperature, we may rearrange Eq 2 and Eq 3 as below:",
            "B and C are a constant for a specific virus and a spacial volume, when virus particles are under normal shear forces during a transmission. For simplification reason, we may assign a numeric value to both B and C, thus the impact of virus particle volume fraction and temperature on the fraction of the infected can be evaluated illustratively. The infected against virus particle volume fraction is plotted in Figure 2. A much stronger dependence of virus particle volume fraction is predicted with MSIR model than MSEIR, possibly due to the buffering effect caused by the \u201cexposed\u201d category in the latter. For MSIR model, an explosive increase of the infection is predicted when virus particle volume reaches about 45%. It looks like a percolation transition phenomenon[34,35], a first-order phase transition frequently observed in amorphous multi-phase systems like colloidal suspensions, where contacts and connections between individual entities play a critical role in controlling physical properties of whole system. The relationship between the infected and virus particle volume fraction seems to be reasonable, as intuitively more infection is expected if many virus particles are present in a system. Some researchers have already claimed that infectious disease transmissions are a percolation phenomenon in nature[36] and applied percolation theory to study epidemic spreading[36,37]. Our prediction is in line with those research work.",
            "The infected is not only dependent on virus particle volume fraction, but also dependent on the temperature, which is shown in Figure 3. The energy barrier term E0 of course determines how temperature may impact disease transmission rate thus the number of the infected. The infected in MSEIR model shows a much stronger temperature dependence and decreases rapidly with temperature changing from 0 to 60 \u25e6C, while the infected in MSIR model just decreases a little bit with temperature. Higher temperatures definitely can reduce disease transmission. From past observations, infectious disease transmissions typically show a seasonal sinusoidal variation. Most infectious diseases like influenza happen in winter time and diminish when spring or summer comes in. Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemics initially started some time in December 2019 at Wuhan, China, has infected more than 75000 people with over 2200 deaths so far. How long time this infectious transmission is going to last and when it will peak are critical information to make proper mitigation strategy. Utilizing the data provided by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) from Jan. 21 to Feb.17, 2020, the fraction of the infected is predicted with both MSIR and MSEIR models and shown in Figure 4. From these data, we are able to determine the reaction rates at each step",
            "0.72, the maximum volume packing fraction of face-centered cubic packing structure, model predicts a stronger dependence on virus particle volume fraction than MSEIR model. S0 is assumed to be 1, too.",
            "and make predictions. As shown in Fig.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] (b), both models predict that the infected may peak about 150 days from January 21, 2019. For MSIR model, the exact peak time and the peak values can be calculated with Eq 24 with the parameters obtained from Fig.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], tm = 158 days and Im = 0.854, corresponding to 170826 infected individuals. For MSEIR model, we cannot have exact solutions to the equation but can estimate using Fig. 4 (b): the peak time is a little longer than the predicted with MSIR model, about 160 days, and has a higher infected fraction about 0.9, corresponding to about 180000 infected individuals. Both models predict a skewed distribution, implying that the fraction of the infected remains at high ends for a relative long time. Please keep in mind that these predictions should be strongly dependent on how the isolation measures are executed and how accurate the data are, which may affect the rate constants used in the calculations.",
            "The fraction of the recovered is important to know, as it directly relates to how many people may survive from this epidemics. The original SIR and SEIR models only consider \u201cthe removed\u201d that may contain both the recovered and the death. Figure 5 shows the recovered (a) and the recovered plus the death (b) against time, predicted with both MSIR and MSEIR models. Theoretically, the same rate constants obtained from the infected data",
            "in Fig. 4 should be used for making predictions for the recovered in Fig. 5. Unfortunately, these two groups of data provided by CCDC don\u2019t match each other and cannot be integrated into one model. If the same parameters like k1, k2, k3, k4, k5 obtained from the infected data were used for the removed data regressions, the predicted with MSIR and MSEIR models were 8 and 13 times smaller than the reported, respectively, no matter that the recovered only or the addition of the recovered and the death is used. In average, there is almost 10 times difference between these two group of data. If the removed data are accurate, then the infected should be 10 times larger than the reported, which turns out that 724360 people should be infected by Feb. 17, 2020. Note that the regressions are relatively poor for the recovered and even worse for the recovered plus the death. The long latency period and lack of an effective drug to cure the disease may add complexity of claiming a patient to be fully recovered for this new kind of disease, which could contribute to the poor regression.",
            "Another critical parameter in infectious disease is the basic reproduction number, R0, which can be computed with Eq 29. With the parameters obtained from the infected data provided by CCDC, the calculated R0 is plotted against time in Figure 6. Initially, R0 is really high, but decays rapidly and approaches a steady value. The predicted steady R0 value is about 3.5 according to MSEIR model and about 1.5 according to MSIR model. Early studies on coronavirus show R0=2.238, 2.6840, and 3.1139. Variation of R0 may stem from the fact that it is not a constant in theory based on our model. Complex estimation methods on R0 make some researchers believe that R0 is not an indicative parameter to use[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,32,33]. However, our method is straightforward and can potentially be used to standardize R0 calculation.",
            "In summary, using same categorical methods as in traditional SIR and SEIR models, we consider infectious disease transmissions to be a sequential chemical reaction and treat the transmission process with the integration of both Eyring\u2019s rate process theory and free volume concept together. Based on the data provided by CCDC, the peak time, the peak infected, the total infected based on the recovered data, and R0 are estimated and shown in table I. These data indicate that current epidemics may last more than a year and total infected people may be between 579488 and 941668.",

        "IV. DISCUSSION": [
            "Disease transmission is difficult to describe, as it is hard to identify the sources of diseases, confirm infected individuals, predict human movement pattern and virus particles transmission pattern, etc. The physical mechanisms and principles governing infectious disease transmissions should be similar to the observed in amorphous disorder systems, such as the percolation transition, Boltzmann distribution probability, the stretched exponential relaxation, etc. Human motion is not a thermal driven movement, however, has been found to follow the same Boltzmann distribution probability. The volume fraction of virus particles should lead to a dramatic increase in transmission rate, similar to percolation transition process. The common many-body problems encountered in chemistry and physics world can be resolved with the integration of Eyring\u2019s rate process theory and free volume concept, which has been demonstrated to work well for many multi-scale systems ranging from electrons to granular particles, even the universe[41]. This approach is therefore naturally applied to the disease transmissions. Attempt made in this article is to understand physical mechanisms of infectious disease transmissions using same categorical methods popularly employed in infectious disease transmission field. Although our focus is put on coronavirus (Covid-19) currently spreading around the world, the theoretical framework proposed in this article can be applied to other transmission diseases, too.",
            "The successful predictions are dependent on data accuracy. For every new type of a virus, the test, identification, diagnostic, and counting methods need time and effort to be properly established. It is fully understandable that the initial data don\u2019t reflect the true epidemic process. We utilize the official data released by CCDC to test our models. The predicted parameters shown in Table I should be used cautiously.",
            "Our approach is relatively simple and straightforward without involving complicated mathematical calculations, in comparison with other theoretical models available in the literature. Extra seasonal force doesn\u2019t need to be inserted into our model for demonstrating the seasonality of infectious diseases, as rate constants are temperature dependent."
        ],
        "V. CONCLUSION": [
            "A sequential chemical reaction process from the susceptible, to the exposed, the infected, and the removed in the end is proposed to describe disease transmissions. At each step, there is a chemical rate constant associated with and the fraction of each product/reactant can be easily calculated. Every step is a one-way reaction, except the last step from the infected to the removed, as some small amount of the removed could be infected again. The Eyring\u2019s rate process theory and free volume concept continue to be used for defining rate constants.",
            "In general, our model predicts that the fraction of the infected will peak at certain time, increase with the volume fraction of virus particles, and decrease with temperature. The energy barrier for human to move has played a critical role in disease transmissions. The isolation process with a huge energy barrier for human can change the chemical reaction rate constant dramatically. The basic reproduction number is not a constant and can be computed once the parameters in the models are determined.",
            "In particular, we applied our models to treat coronavirus (Covid-19) transmission. Based on the data provided by CCDC, we predict that the infected may peak at 158 days from Jan. 21, 2020 and may take a long time, more than a year, to drop to zero, though MSIR and MSEIR models give a slightly different estimation. The data of the infected don\u2019t match with the removed for both models: based on the infected data, the removed is predicted to be 8 and 13 times smaller than the actual reported according to MSIR and MSEIR models. If the removed data, either the recovered or the recovered plus the death, are reliable, the actual infected people is between 579488 and 941668 by Feb. 17, 2020. The basic reproduction number of coronavirus (Covid-19) is computed to be about 1.5 based on MSIR model and 3.5 based on MSEIR model."
