        "abstract": "Background: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is on-going in China and appears to approach late phase. It is highly demanding to estimate how many COVID-19 patients will die eventually. In this study, an estimate of the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces is provided. The results may help to eluate the severity of the epidemic and facilitate mental health care. \n\nMethods: Data of the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths from January 21 to February 29, 2020, released daily by the National Health Commission of China and Hubei Provincial Health Commission, were used. The Boltzmann function was explored to simulate the data in each region. By using these established functions, the potential total number of deaths were forecasted. In addition, data of the cumulative number of 2003 SARS deaths in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were collected from the WHO official website and analyzed in a similar manner. A Monte Carlo technique was applied to analyze the uncertainty of the estimates of the cumulative confirmed cases, and the results are presented using the resulting mean, median, and a 95% confidence interval (CI). For comparison, the potential total numbers of deaths were estimated by Richards function-based regression analyses.\n\nFindings: The data of cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths with respect to each region were all well-fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 for all the regression analyses being close to 0.999). Consistently, the data for the cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. The potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, other provinces, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other cities in Hubei were estimated to be 3260 (95% CI 3187, 3394), 110 [109, 112], 3174 (3095, 3270), 2550 (2494, 2621) and 617 [607, 632], respectively. Similar results were obtained by Richards function-based regression analysis.\n\nInterpretation: The observation that the data of the cumulative numbers of deaths for both the on-going COVID-19 outbreak and the 2003 SARS epidemic in each geographic region were well fitted with the Boltzmann function strongly suggests that it is suitable for the simulation of deaths associated with coronaviruses-induced diseases. The estimation of COVID-19 deaths may help governments to evaluate the severity of the outbreak and also facilitate timely mental health care for the families of dead patients.",
