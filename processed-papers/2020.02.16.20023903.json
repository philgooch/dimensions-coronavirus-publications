        "abstract": "Background Since late December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and continued to spread throughout China and across the globe. To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported.\nMethods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases.\nResults Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-\u03b3 by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%).\nConclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-\u03b3 production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.",

            "Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of respiratory viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe<br/><br/>Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], both of which are zoonotic in origin and induce fatal lower respiratory tract infection as well as extrapulmonary manifestations. The new coronavirus, designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2<br/><br/>(SARS-CoV-2), is a member of Beta-CoV lineage B, which was first identified in Wuhan, China by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Recent reports have provided evidence for person to person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in family and hospital settings eclipsed 14000, exceeding the total number of SARS cases during the 2003 epidemic, and more than 300 people had now died. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2-induced Coronavirus<br/><br/>Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put health authorities on high alert in China and across the globe.<br/><br/>It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a genome sequence 75% to 80% identical to the<br/><br/>SARS-CoV and has more similarities to several bat coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Both clinical and epidemiological features of patients with COVID-19 have recently been reported, demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause clusters of severe respiratory illness with clinical presentations greatly resembling SARS-CoV, leading to ICU admission and high mortality[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Clinical manifestations have included fever, fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, a study of the first 41 laboratory-confirmed cases with COVID-19 showed that 63% of patients had lymphopenia, and cytokine storm could be associated with disease severity. However, little is known about immunologic features between severe and moderate forms of COVID-197."

Consistent with previous reports[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], in this present study, a male predominance in the incidence of COVID-19 has been noted similar to that of SARS-CoV, indicating males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than females. Older males (>50 years old), in particular those with chronic comorbidities may be more likely to develop severe COVID-19, and associated with a high mortality (28.6% of males aged >50 years old with comorbidities). The most common clinical manifestations at onset of illness included fever, cough, fatigue and myalgia. Severe cases were more likely to have dyspnea and significantly lower PaO2/FiO2, and to develop ARDS. In terms of laboratory finding, leukocytosis (\u226510\u00d7 10 /L) but lymphopenia (<0.8\u00d7 10 /L) were more common in severe cases than moderate cases.

Second, this study only included a small number of patients, thus the results should be interpreted with caution, and statistical non-significance may not rule out difference between severe and moderate cases. Third, since data regarding the viremia profile of SARS-CoV-2 are not available, further studies are needed to investigate the correlation between the virus load kinetics and the dynamics of cellular immune responses.

Both clinical and epidemiological features of patients with COVID-19 have recently been reported[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. However, there is insufficient knowledge of pathophysiological parameters as well as immunologic indicators to understand the mechanism involved in COVID-19. Consistent with previous reports[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], in this present study, a male predominance in the incidence of COVID-19 has been noted similar to that of SARS-CoV, indicating males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than females. Older males (>50 years old), in particular those with chronic comorbidities may be more likely to develop severe COVID-19, and associated with a high mortality (28.6% of males aged >50 years old with comorbidities). The most common clinical manifestations at onset of illness included fever, cough, fatigue and myalgia. Severe cases were more likely to have dyspnea and significantly lower PaO2/FiO2, and to develop ARDS. In terms of laboratory finding, leukocytosis (\u226510\u00d7 10 /L) but lymphopenia (<0.8\u00d7 10 /L) were more common in severe cases than moderate cases. ALT, LDH, D-dimer and inflammatory markers including hsCRP and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases than moderate cases.",
            "Plasma concentrations of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2R, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 increased in the majority of severe cases and was significantly higher than did those in moderate cases, suggesting cytokine storms might be associated with disease severity.",
            "Additionally, we also noted that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause a significant reduction in peripheral blood lymphocytes and T cell subsets. Although the proportions of T cells subsets in peripheral blood remained within the normal range in most patients, the prevalence of decreasing CD4+T cell counts and CD8+T cell counts was considerably high in both severe and moderate cases. It is notable that both the proportion and number of B cells were not frequently decreased in these patients. More importantly, the number of CD4+T cells and",
            "CD8+T cells was markedly lower in severe cases than moderate cases. Albeit diminished",
            "CD8+ T cells, the proportion of HLA-DR+ expression on CD8+T cells over 35% was more common in severe cases than those of moderate cases. The expression of HLA-DR on human",
            "T cells has been regarded primarily as a marker of activated T cells. However, It has been recently indicated that CD8+ HLA-DR+ T cells constitute to a natural subset of Treg and may exert suppressive effect involving CTLA-4 signaling between neighboring T cells 10 . Besides, six out of eight severe cases and none of moderate cases with available immunologic data exhibited a broad, significant decline in all the lymphocyte subsets excluding B cells, with total T lymphocyte counts below 400 \u00d7 106/L, CD8+T cells below 150 \u00d7 106/L, and NK cells below<77 \u00d7 106/L, of these six patients, three (50%) eventually died, indicating that",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with severe lymphopenia have high-risk of developing severe",
            "COVID-19 and extremely high mortality. Moreover, the production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD4+T cells but not CD8+T cells or NK cells tended to be lower in severe cases than moderate cases.",
            "These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in diminished number as well as their IFN-\u03b3 production, which might be correlated with disease severity of COVID-19.",
            "CD4+ T cells play a pivotal role in regulating immune responses, orchestrating the deletion and amplification of immune cells, especially CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells facilitate virus-specific antibody production via the T-dependent activation of B cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. However, CD8+",
            "T cells exert their effects mainly through two mechanisms, cytolytic activities against target cells or cytokines secretion, including IFN-\u03b3 , TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 as well as many chemokines[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",
            "The production of IFN-\u03b3 is essential for the resistance against infection of various pathogens such as virus, bacteria, and parasite[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. As a major source of IFN-\u03b3, the ability of T cells to respond to infection is part of the adaptive immune response and takes days to develop a prominent IFN-\u03b3 response.",
            "The roles of T cell responses in the context of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have been previously studied. Likewise, patients who survived SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections usually had better immune responses than those who did not[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The immune system plays an important role in both diseases, but it is differentially affected by the two viruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. A study in SARS-CoV mice model has shown that depletion of CD8+ T cells at the time of infection does not affect viral replication or clearance. However, depletion of CD4+ T cells leads to an enhanced immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of",
            "SARS-CoV from the lungs, demonstrating the vital role of CD4+ T but not CD8+ T cells in primary SARS-CoV infection demonstrated that the majority of infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium are CD8+ T cells that play an important role in virus clearance as well as in immune-mediated injury[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. After comparing T cell-deficient mice and B cell-deficient mice, it is found that T cells are able to survive and kill virus-infected cells in the MERS-CoV infected lung 18. These data highlight the importance of T lymphocytes, in particular, CD4+ T cells but not B cells in controlling and finetuning the pathogenesis and outcomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection.",
            "Hin Chu et al demonstrated that MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV can efficiently infect T cells from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid organs, and induce apoptosis in T cells, which involves the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. This may partly explain the lymphopenia observed in MERS-CoV-infected patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The inability of the SARS-CoV to infect T cells may be ascribed to the lower expression of the SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression (ACE2) in T cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Several recent structural analyses predict that SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 as its host receptor 20. Therefore, these findings indicate that T cells might not be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV can also significantly decrease peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets and it was related to the onset of illness 21. Several potential mechanisms may be involved, including the development of auto-immune antibodies or immune complexes triggered by viral infection, directly infecting and promoting the growth inhibition and apoptosis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as the use of glucocorticoids, which may account for the decrease of lymphocytes in some SARS patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infection, in this present study, some patients were administered methylprednisolone, the average dosage was a bit higher in severe cases (40-80mg once a day) than moderate cases (20-40mg once a day). Since corticosteroids have a profound effect on circulating T lymphocytes, which may involve their movement out of the intra-vascular",
            ". A Chinese study in SARS-CoV-infected patients has compartment[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. In this study, we could not exclude the possibility that some of the lymphopenia may be associated with use of steroids, but it does not account for all the cases, and certainly not for the lymphopenia at the initial presentation. Further research is required to determine the effects of corticosteroid on lymphocytes in the patient with COVID-19.",
            "Our study has some limitations. First of all, we mainly evaluated the number of T cell subsets and NK cells as well as their IFN-\u03b3 production, the function of these cells, and the role of activated macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrating lung parenchyma remain unclear. Second, this study only included a small number of patients, thus the results should be interpreted with caution, and statistical non-significance may not rule out difference between severe and moderate cases. Third, since data regarding the viremia profile of SARS-CoV-2 are not available, further studies are needed to investigate the correlation between the virus load kinetics and the dynamics of cellular immune responses. Clarification of these questions will allow further dissection of the complex SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, with potential implications for the development of therapeutics and vaccines.",
            "In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, especially may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19. Gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that influence lymphocytes particularly CD4+T cell counts and their decrease in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is of importance for clinical management of COVID-19.",
