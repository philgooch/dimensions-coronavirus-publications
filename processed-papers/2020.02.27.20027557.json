        "abstract": "The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.",

            "DIP suppresses HCoV-19 replication in Vero E6 cells<br/><br/>We virtually screened an FDA approved drug library and found that DIP bound to the HCoV-19 protease Mpro (Figure S1). Hydrophobic and hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions are the main driving forces for the binding between DIP and Mpro. According to the free energy perturbation calculation, the binding free energy of  Gpred was -6.34 kcal/mol. An SPR assay was carried out to validate the in silico result. This has revealed that DIP bound to Mpro with an experimentally confirmed affinity of 34 \u03bcM (KD,eq) (Figure 1A-B).<br/><br/>To demonstrate directly that DIP suppresses HCoV-19 replication, we measured the viral titers using a susceptible cell line, the Vero E6 cells.

            "We found that DIP adjunctive treatment was effective in preventing hypercoagulability if applied early in the severe COVID-19 patients. DIP treatment blunted the increase in D-dimer levels and increased circulating platelet and leucocytes counts, and thus was associated with overall remarkable clinical cure and remission rates. High levels of D-dimer closely correlated with pulmonary embolism,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] vascular thrombosis, and renal dysfunction.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] It is an important prognostic factor of whether ICU-patients may recover from severe infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>] As such, the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypercoagulability effects of DIP could reduce the risk of micro-vascular thrombosis in HCoV-19 infected patients. This could in turn improve vascular circulation and restore vital functions of important organs such as heart and kidney.",
            "In summary, we suggest anti-coagulant therapy for COVID-19 patients with early signs of elevated",
            "D-dimer levels. DIP is an attractive anti-coagulant adjunctive therapy due to its safe clinical profile as an anti-platelet agent. It also holds additional benefits as a pan-PDE inhibitor in eliciting broad-spectrum antiviral immunity, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Moreover, the wide availability, safety and affordability of DIP argue for further investigation into its therapeutic use in COVID-19, particularly in the event of its rapid spread into the developing counties.",
