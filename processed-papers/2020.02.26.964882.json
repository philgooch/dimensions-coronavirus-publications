        "abstract": "A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03bcM. Ebselen also exhibited strong antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.",

            "In the last twenty years, new infectious agents have emerged to cause epidemics, such as<br/><br/>SARS and MERS11. The timely development of effective antiviral agents for clinical use is extremely challenging because conventional drug development approaches normally take years of investigations and cost billions of dollars pharmaceutical drugs and drug candidates provides an alternative approach to rapidly identify potential drug leads to manage rapidly emerging viral infections[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Cell-based phenotypic screening has proven to be valuable[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], but the corresponding methodological complexity is not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines, and fails to inform the identity of the molecular target or mechanism of action[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. In this regard, we combined structure-based ab initio drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening to discover new drugs for treating COVID-19 infection. The convergence of these three approaches proved to be an efficient strategy in finding three lead compounds with good antiviral activity. Ebselen is of particular interest for further investigation since its safety in humans has been supported by different clinical trials[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>].

            "Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening, and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key coronavirus enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Seven of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.48 to 16.62 \u03bcM. Ebselen, thiadiazolidinone-8",

            "In the last twenty years, new infectious agents have emerged to cause epidemics, such as",
            "SARS and MERS11. The timely development of effective antiviral agents for clinical use is extremely challenging because conventional drug development approaches normally take years of investigations and cost billions of dollars pharmaceutical drugs and drug candidates provides an alternative approach to rapidly identify potential drug leads to manage rapidly emerging viral infections[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Cell-based phenotypic screening has proven to be valuable[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], but the corresponding methodological complexity is not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines, and fails to inform the identity of the molecular target or mechanism of action[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. In this regard, we combined structure-based ab initio drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening to discover new drugs for treating COVID-19 infection. The convergence of these three approaches proved to be an efficient strategy in finding three lead compounds with good antiviral activity. Ebselen is of particular interest for further investigation since its safety in humans has been supported by different clinical trials[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Our methodology establishes a paradigm of rapid discovering drug leads with clinical potential in response to new emerging infectious diseases lacking specific drugs and vaccines.",
            "The crystal structural and docking data have shown that these drug leads can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 Mpro. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV Mpros share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket, which serves as a drug target for broad-spectrum inhibitor design[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of structural data for CoV Mpros from various species provided the opportunity to further examine our previous hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of Mpros[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] have shown that the most variable regions were the helical domain III and surface loops, but the substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains I and II are still highly conserved among all CoV Mpros, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting at this site should have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 4). This strongly supports our hypothesis that development of a single antiviral agent could provide an effective first line of defense against all CoV-associated diseases."

However, the selenium atom of ebselen could not be treated by any of these above methods, so sulfur was used to replace it in the calculations. Then the obtained optimal superposition of these molecules were used to assist the reasonability of the predicted binding poses from the two docking methods, and only the binding orientations which were consistent among different methods were kept for constructing the initial complexes. Finally, these complexes were further optimized (refined binding poses are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 4) and re-scored (shown in Extended Data Table 2) by using MM-GBSA module[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] of Schr\u00f6dinger, and the residues within 5 \u00c5 around the ligand were refined.",
