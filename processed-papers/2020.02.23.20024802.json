        "abstract": "Background\nAn outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020.\nMethods\nWe collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. \nResults\nThe feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (R-square&gt;0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both COVID-19 and SARS. While all three population groups of SARS are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19.\nConclusions\nOur model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well. Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different. The duration of the outbreak would be shorter for COVID-19.",

We used a differential equation in logistic form to describe the dynamics of the infected, dead and healed cases caused by COVID-19 respectively (See Methods). The increasing of the population no matter in which type of case (infection, death or recovery) has multiple reasons. When the outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, it did not cause too much concern at the beginning so that it leads to many infections and starts to export potential exposed cases to other provinces. But as the successive closure of the cities in Hubei province, and isolation of the community in all the provinces in mainland China, the virus spread tendency was weakened. In our model, we also considered these measures taken by the government. We rewrote Eq (1) to Eq (9)."

The coronavirus was firstly named as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020 and may have a probable bat origin (Zhou et al, 2020). Human to human transmission through 2019-nCoV has been confirmed among closed contacts since the middle of December 2019 (Wang et al 2020; Li et al, 2020). As of February 12, 2020, infections of 2019-nCoV have been identified in all Chinese provincial administrative regions and in dozens of countries around the world (Munster et al, 2020; Holshue et al, 2020; Ki et al, 2020; Shigemura et al, 2020; Nshiera et al, 2020).

Previous studies have showed that daily cumulative number of patients could be explained by logistic function (Huang et al, 2003; Wang et al, 2003). Based on the above assumption and previous studies, we modeled the epidemic information of virus as logistic form (Eq (1))",

Hubei province contributed a majority of cases to this statistical numbers (Fig 1A). Based on the limited infected case data in the early and middle phase of this new coronavirus outbreak, we firstly established a descriptive model with three parameters for each of the 31 provinces in mainland China by (Fig 1B & Fig 2B, See Methods). Fitting goodness of models was expressed by the R-square, which ranged from 0.95 to 0.999, indicating that the models we established fitted the data well. The panel B of Figure 1 illustrates examples of time series data of infected cases and corresponding fitting curves in four provinces (provinces of Xinjiang, Beijing, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Heilongjiang).

Based on our assumption, the growth pattern was supposed to follow a sigmoid form, and the parameter k here denotes how rapid the number of infected cases get to saturate. If k is large, the S form of the curve would be sharp, and the curve will rise up very quickly to be saturated to the maximum number. While if k is only slightly larger than 0, the curve would show a slow and smooth increase from 0 to the maximum.",
            "To further illustrate the spatial distribution of the infected cases\u2019 growth pattern, we exerted further analyses of the fitted infected case curves of 30 provinces. We excluded Tibet in this analysis because the number of confirmed infected case did not increase since Jan 29, 2020. And the only one confirmed case in Tibet has been cured on Feb 12. The spatial distribution of parameter k is shown in Fig 2A, illustrating provinces varied in the increase patterns of cumulative infected cases. Fitted curves of provinces such as Jilin and Qinghai has larger value of k, which means that the number of infections peaked earlier in these regions than in other provinces. By contrast, provinces like Hainan, Hebei, Ningxia, has smaller value of k than other provinces, suggesting the infections of these provinces would continue increasing when infections of other provinces reach saturation (Fig 2B).

Since the time series data of SARS was full phase of the outbreak, the parameters estimated by our model was solid (R-square>0.95).",

            "The outbreak of SARS in Beijing was the most serious among all the provincial administrative regions, and the outbreak of COVID-19 was most serious in Hubei province.

For both SARS and COVID-19, their infected curves have the lowest semi-saturation period (Fig 4 EJ), while cured curves have the highest which is in keeping with the common sense that the cure is always later than infection and death. For both SARS in Beijing and COVID-19 in",

        "Discussion": [
            "We modeled the epidemiologic characteristics of 2019-nCoV for 31 provinces in mainland China based on the data from Jan 20 to Feb 19 during the outbreak.",
            "Furthermore, we compared these characteristics with SARS in 2003 using the same model framework.",
            "Compared with dynamical models such as SIR (Susceptible \u2013 Infectious - Recovered) or SEIR (Susceptible \u2013 Exposed - Infectious - Recovered), our model is relatively simple but robust. We used a differential equation in logistic form to describe the dynamics of the infected, dead and healed cases caused by COVID-19 respectively (See Methods). The increasing of the population no matter in which type of case (infection, death or recovery) has multiple reasons. When the outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, it did not cause too much concern at the beginning so that it leads to many infections and starts to export potential exposed cases to other provinces. But as the successive closure of the cities in Hubei province, and isolation of the community in all the provinces in mainland China, the virus spread tendency was weakened. In our model, we also considered these measures taken by the government. We rewrote Eq (1) to Eq (9).",
            "where \u03b1 is growth rate of the number of infections; I(t) is cumulative number of infections at time t; r could be understood as a parameter to reflect the effect of measures aiming at controlling the virus spread. Here we have decomposed I t into two parts. The first part \u03b1I t could represent the rapid infections growth in the early phase of the outbreak without any measures for epidemic control. The second part rI ! t measures for epidemic control. For death cases, this idea still holds. But things are different for cured case. In contrast, at the early phase of the outbreak, the number of cured cases increase slowly. But once there are effective treatments, the number of illustrates the slower infections growth after taking effective isolation cured cases will rise up quickly. The growth of cured cases would again be slow since the number of patients is limited. All these facts were considered in our highly summarized model (Eq (8)) in a macroscopic scale. All data sets have a R-square greater than 0.95 when fitted by our framework, so that we could further discuss some intrinsic mechanisms for the growth rules of infection, death and recovery through the parameters estimated from the model (See Methods).",
            "The value of k from Eq (8) is a critical parameter. k represents how rapid the number of infected cases get to the saturation. We found the variability of k values among fitted curves of infected COVID-19 cases in 30 provinces (Fig 2 AB) is large (Ranging from 0.19 to 0.38). It is clear to show the real situation in each province and this guides us to be more careful against the epidemic. Further we compared this characteristics between COVID-19 and SARS in 2003 in typical provinces (Fig 3 AB).",
            "We noted that k values of fitted COVID-19 infection curves in 30 provinces of mainland China (exclude Tibet) are larger than that of SARS in Beijing 2003 (Fig 3",
            "SARS in 2003. This result may related to several aspects. Firstly, it may due to the basic spread property of the virus. Besides, the isolation policy of all the provinces in mainland China was more strictly enforced than it was in 2003. Moreover, the improved clinical skills today may also helpful for shortening the duration of epidemic.",
            "Furthermore, we analyzed semi-saturation period (Fig 4 EK) (t0 in Eq (8)) and make comparison in three types of cases (infection, death and recovery) (Fig 4 A-C G-I).",
            "Our model could fit them very well (R-square \u2265 (R \u2212 s). k values for the fitted curves of the three types of cases caused by COVID-19 were larger than that of SARS, while t0 values were the opposite. This again suggests that the epidemic of COVID-19 will be quicker to pass away than SARS. For both SARS and COVID-19, fitted curves of infections have lowest semi-saturation period (Fig 4 EK), while fitted curves of cured cases have the highest semi-saturation period, which follows the common sense that the cure was always later than infection and death since it costs time to get on the research of effect plans to cure the patients. For both SARS and",
            "COVID-19, the k value of infected case curve was larger than that of cured curve, while that of death case is the lowest."
