        "abstract": "Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong.\n\nMethod: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected.\n\nResult: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (&gt;77%) and considered effective (&gt;90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07).\n\nDiscussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.",

            "This study provides timely assessment of the risk perception, information exposure and adoption of precautionary measures during the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong.

Despite disease uncertainty (including transmissibility, route of transmission and pathogenicity) at the early stage, individuals in the community had high perceived risk towards COVID-19 at large, viz: high perceived susceptibility and high perceived severity. A slightly increasing general anxiety level was observed over the three-week study period. Enhanced personal hygiene and travel avoidance were adopted by nearly all respondents, higher propensity of adopting greater degree of social-distancing measures were associated with being female, living in the NT, perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 well, work status except students and being more anxious.",
            "Our results have several immediate and significant public health implications. First, our results provide the baseline psychological and behavioral responses of the community against which current infection control strategies fit in. With the high perceived risk and large proportion of individuals adopting preventive measures in the community at the beginning, during which the accumulated number of local cases is 68 (as of 21 February 2020) with a significant initial portion of them being imported cases [18], we have an edge to block local transmission. This suggests that efforts to curb imported cases were efficient at the early phase of this outbreak. Following the recent enactment of a 14-day quarantine period for individuals entering Hong Kong from the mainland China, and the emergence of clustered local cases [19], the next important strategy on the agenda is to stabilize the supply of preventive materials, such as masks, so that the blockage of local transmission chain can be sustained. This is particularly important during the 24-day incubation period [20] associated with an elevated influx of individuals from the Mainland to Hong Kong between the announcement date (5 February 2020) and the effective date (8 February 2020) of the 14-day quarantine policy, and the recent emergence of superspreaders to speed up local transmission.",
            "Second, our results reveal the risk perception in the community, which is an important piece of information to enhance epidemic control [21]. Although the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic is",

            "A score in our survey (9.01) suggests that the community was borderline abnormal in terms of anxiety.",
            "Despite the slight difference in the inclusion of measurement items, the community was seemingly more anxious about the current COVID-19 epidemic (mean STAI score=2.00) than the 2009 pandemic influenza (mean STAI score = 1.8) [22], but was less worried than the SARS outbreak in 2003 (mean",
            "STAI score = 2.24) [23]. The significant time trend associated with HADS-A (Figure 2) suggests that the community became more and more anxious as new cases and new incidences came up (Figure 1).",
            "Third, our results suggest an alternative strategy for better risk communication. The large proportion of respondents were alert to COVID-19 (99.5%) or actively searching for related information (83%)",
            "highlighted the role of social media in shaping risk perception and epidemic-related emotion. It is particularly important amid of much disease uncertainty as mass scares can be triggered easily.",
            "Considering the high level of trust given by respondents to doctors and the low level of trust to the two most frequently used information sources, social platform and websites, health officials can collaborate frequently with associations of medical doctors, and invite them to help propagating official information in more sociable channels. This strategy is deemed more acceptable by the community than relying solely on the official channel, given only 16% of respondents rates official websites as reliable or very reliable. Our results also shortlisted information preferred by the community among an upsurge of disease-related information during the early stage (Table 5).",
            "Fourth, our results pinpoint the drivers for greater level of adoption of social-distancing precautionary measures. In line with literatures that being female and an elevated anxiety level prompted compliance of precautionary measures [23, 24], we also identified similar association in this survey (Table 6).",

The COVID-19 epidemic was amid of the Chinese New Year holidays and a series of large-scale social-distancing interventions enacted by Hong Kong government, particularly the home-office arrangement for employees. Therefore, the conventional random digit dialing approach adopted in the past local outbreaks [22, 23, 28] was not possible. And the involvement of all 452 DCCA councilors allows a thorough representation of every district in Hong Kong in the absence of a universal email database.",
            "This study has two limitations. First, with an online approach, responses of those without internet access, particularly the oldest age group (55 years or above), were under-represented. Despite this, online surveys were the only feasible means of data collection during outbreak times. Second, this survey was conducted during the early phase that temporal variations of responses are not captured as the epidemic progresses. However, contact information were collected from this study cohort and follow-up surveys will be carried out as the disease progresses.",
            "To conclude, we identified high risk-perception towards COVID-19 in the community, with the anxiety level higher than pandemic influenza but lower than SARS. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression of COVID-19, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied biological and mechanistic aspects of COVID-19, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent intervention and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses."

            "In light of the importance of host behavior in mitigating transmission and the vision to inform policy formation in a timely manner, this study aims to examine risk perceptions and behavioral responses of the general community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic"
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "Subject recruitment<br/><br/>A cross-sectional online survey was conducted within 36 hours after the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Hong Kong.",
            "To ensure good coverage of the general community in Hong Kong, chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of all eighteen district councils and all individual councilors of the.",
            "District councilors were invited to share the survey link and promotion messages on their webpages, social media platforms or any channels which they usually use to convey information to their targeted residents, but in general there was no restriction on their dissemination.",
            "To avoid duplicated responses from the same respondent, the survey could only be taken once from the same electronic device"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "The authors' survey period covers important clinical incidences, including first local death case and first overseas death case (Philippines), and social incidences, including healthcare workers on strike to call for entire border shutdown",
            "It was amid of the start-up of large-scale social-distancing interventions, including halt of sales of high-speed rail tickets to and from Wuhan, closure of public cultural and leisure facilities and deferral of school resumption."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures.",
            "With the high perceived risk and large proportion of individuals adopting preventive measures in the community at the beginning, during which the accumulated number of local cases is 68 with a significant initial portion of them being imported cases [18], the authors have an edge to block local transmission",
            "This suggests that efforts to curb imported cases were efficient at the early phase of this outbreak.",
            "This is important during the 24-day incubation period [20] associated with an elevated influx of individuals from the Mainland to Hong Kong between the announcement date (5 February 2020) and the effective date (8 February 2020) of the 14-day quarantine policy, and the recent emergence of superspreaders to speed up local transmission"
