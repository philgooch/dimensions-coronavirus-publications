        "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses\u2019 similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants.",

            "In summary, the above findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to human ACE2 with similar affinities and hence may have similar transmissibility. Antibodies targeting the RBM regions may be more potent due to their ACE2 blocking activities but cross-protecting antibodies targeting the RBM regions may be more difficult to obtain because of the lower degree of sequence conservation. Antibodies to the more conserved regions outside the RBM motif may possess cross-protective neutralizing activities but may be less potent due to the lack of ACE2 blocking activities. Mechanism of neutralization for the non-blocking RBD antibodies remains to be investigated. Developing potent and cross-protective therapeutic antibodies and vaccines is possible but could be challenging."

            "SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex structure modeling reveals almost identical structure configuration and affinity to SARS-CoV<br/><br/>The structure model for SARS-CoVRBD-ACE2 complex was optimized based on the complex\u2019s crystal structure (PDB ID: 2AJF) (http://www.rcsb.org/). The structure model for SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex was constructed by homology modeling using the optimized SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex crystal structure as a template, based on a 73.7% amino acid sequence homology between the two viruses. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of C\u03b1 atoms between the two complex structures is 0.703 \u00c5, indicating an almost identical structural conformation (Figure1B). There are subtle differences in the RBD-ACE2 interfaces between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at the loop 469-470 (numbered according to SARS-CoV RBD), arising from a one-residue insertion after residue 469 (Figure 1A).<br/><br/>On the other hand, the interaction patterns in both complex structures\u2019 interfaces are somewhat different (Figure 1A and Table S2). Four residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (i.e. N439, G476, Q498, and N501) lost their interactions with ACE2 as compared with the corresponding residues in SARS-CoV RBD (i.e. R426, D463, Y484, and T487), four replacing residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (i.e. K417, V445, E484, and F486) form new interactions with ACE2, which are absent in the SARS-CoV RBD (corresponding to V404, S432, P470, and L472) (Figure 1A&C). It is noteworthy that although a strong salt-bridge presented between R426 of SARS-CoV RBD and E329 of ACE2, is missing in the interaction involving SARS-CoV-2 RBD. However, a new strong salt-bridge interaction between E484 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and K31 of ACE2 compensates for that loss."

            "Coronavirus spike protein has been shown to be responsible for interacting with host cell receptors to initiate infection. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses use human ACE2 for cell entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Due to the nature of RNA virus\u2019 rapid mutation rates, changes in the S-protein\u2019s amino acid sequence, especially in the RBD\u2019s receptor binding motif, could have significant impact on virus infectivity, pathogenicity, transmissibility, and cross-protection from previous coronavirus infection, as well as therapeutic antibody and prophylactic vaccine development. Hence, understanding the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and their implications may offer significant scientific and practical value.<br/><br/>Though it is difficult to assess the virus-host-cell interactions with real virion, we studied the new SARS-CoV-2 in head-to-head comparisons with SARS-CoV using multiple methods. Measurements of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins to recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing 293T cells confirmed the two coronaviruses\u2019 similar binding affinities to human ACE2 (Figure 2A&B), which provided direct molecular based evidences to support and possibly explain the observation that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has similar transmissibility to SARS-CoV virus."

            "SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses\u2019 similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants.",

            "The structure model for SARS-CoVRBD-ACE2 complex was optimized based on the complex\u2019s crystal structure (PDB ID: 2AJF) (http://www.rcsb.org/). The structure model for SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex was constructed by homology modeling using the optimized SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex crystal structure as a template, based on a 73.7% amino acid sequence homology between the two viruses. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of C\u03b1 atoms between the two complex structures is 0.703 \u00c5, indicating an almost identical structural conformation (Figure1B). There are subtle differences in the RBD-ACE2 interfaces between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at the loop 469-470 (numbered according to SARS-CoV RBD), arising from a one-residue insertion after residue 469 (Figure 1A).",
            "On the other hand, the interaction patterns in both complex structures\u2019 interfaces are somewhat different (Figure 1A and Table S2). Four residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (i.e. N439, G476, Q498, and N501) lost their interactions with ACE2 as compared with the corresponding residues in SARS-CoV RBD (i.e. R426, D463, Y484, and T487), four replacing residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (i.e. K417, V445, E484, and F486) form new interactions with ACE2, which are absent in the SARS-CoV RBD (corresponding to V404, S432, P470, and L472) (Figure 1A&C). It is noteworthy that although a strong salt-bridge presented between R426 of SARS-CoV RBD and E329 of ACE2, is missing in the interaction involving SARS-CoV-2 RBD. However, a new strong salt-bridge interaction between E484 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and K31 of ACE2 compensates for that loss.",

Binding curves of S1 protein to ACE2 expressing 293T cells was further assessed using FACS. Again, similar binding curves and EC50 values were obtained for the two viruses (Figure 2B).

            "Significant micro-structure differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs exist in their RBM regions As suggested by the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence alignment analysis (Figure 1A), the 50% RBM sequence homology is much less than the 73.7% RBD sequence homology. Structure similarity analysis confirms the presence of significant local structure differences in the RBM regions, while the rest of the RBD regions have significantly higher similarities (Figure 4). Moreover, three glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV RBD (i.e. N318, N330, and N357)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] was conserved, although one of the glycosylation sites, N357, may not be glycosylated in the corresponding residue of SARS-CoV-2 as predicted by NetNGlyc[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Taking the two viruses\u2019 RBD structure similarities and glycosylation sites into account, we predict that there are two possible conserved regions in RBD where epitopes for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies reside. These regions probably do not overlap with the ACE2 binding sites (Figure 4). We speculate that it is more likely to obtain cross-reactive and non-blocking neutralizing antibodies targeting the conserved regions outside the RBM region. The neutralization mechanism for these non-blocking but cross-reactive antibodies is likely unrelated to ACE2 blockage.",

Note that N357ST in SARS-CoV is changed to N370SA in SARS-CoV-2, which is different from the NXS/T pattern required for glycosylation, and hence this site is more likely to be unglycosylated. The two possible cross-reactive regions are marked with yellow circles."

        "Discussion": [
            "Coronavirus spike protein has been shown to be responsible for interacting with host cell receptors to initiate infection. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses use human ACE2 for cell entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Due to the nature of RNA virus\u2019 rapid mutation rates, changes in the S-protein\u2019s amino acid sequence, especially in the RBD\u2019s receptor binding motif, could have significant impact on virus infectivity, pathogenicity, transmissibility, and cross-protection from previous coronavirus infection, as well as therapeutic antibody and prophylactic vaccine development. Hence, understanding the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and their implications may offer significant scientific and practical value.",
            "Though it is difficult to assess the virus-host-cell interactions with real virion, we studied the new SARS-CoV-2 in head-to-head comparisons with SARS-CoV using multiple methods. Measurements of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins to recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing 293T cells confirmed the two coronaviruses\u2019 similar binding affinities to human ACE2 (Figure 2A&B), which provided direct molecular based evidences to support and possibly explain the observation that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has similar transmissibility to SARS-CoV virus.",
            "Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are both coronaviruses with over 70% sequence homology and share the same human receptor ACE2, analyzing SARS-CoV\u2019s antibodies\u2019 cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 may provide useful information on whether neutralizing epitopes were conserved on the two coronaviruses. Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced with SARS-CoV S1 and RBD proteins had potent binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV but only modest cross-binding and cross-neutralizing activities to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. Four highly potent ACE2 blocking SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies showed binding affinities to SARS-CoV S1 protein in the range of 0.2 nM to 8.7 pM, and very high neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV. As low as 0.2 ug/mL nAb can lead to 100% neutralization of SARS-CoV PSV. However, virtually no cross-binding or cross neutralizing activities against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected with the four ACE2 blocking monoclonal antibodies.",
            "We then screened non-ACE2-blocking antibodies raised from SARS-CoV RBD for neutralizing activities. Three such monoclonal antibodies were identified. Although, binding affinities to SARS-CoV S1 protein was significantly lower with EC50 between 55 to 224 \u03bcg/mL as compared to 16 to 42 \u03bcg/mL EC50 for the four ACE2-blocking nAbs, significant cross-binding activities to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and modest cross-neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV were detected.",
            "The observation that these three antibodies bind to and neutralize both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 without blocking ACE2 suggest the following. First, the epitope or epitopes for these three antibodies are conserved across the two significantly different coronaviruses. Hence it is possible but maybe challenging to identify antibodies with potent neutralizing activities to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and ideally to their mutant virus strains as well. Second, the epitope or epitopes for the three nAbs are likely located outside the RBM motif due to their non-ACE2 blocking features and the fact that homology in the RBM motif between the two viruses is significantly lower than the rest portion of the RBD.",
            "An analysis on the mutations in RBD was also conducted. We analyzed 68 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants in GISAID and found 4 variants with mutations in RBD (one has N354D/D364Y, two have V367F, and one has F342L). Alignment of 111 SARS-CoV RBD sequences, collected by BLAST via NCBI website[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>], was used for ConSurf analysis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. As shown in Figure 5, the SARS-CoV RBM region is highly variable, making it more challenging to develop cross-reactive antibodies with broad spectrum of neutralizing activities against mutant strains. On the other hand, significant portions of RBD (marked in pink) outside the RBM motif are highly conserved. Neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes in these regions could potentially have cross-protective activities against different mutant strains.",
            "It is also noteworthy that the three non-blocking antibodies\u2019 neutralizing activities are significantly lower than the four blocking antibodies. Due to the limited number of antibodies obtained, it is difficult to conclude whether there is a consistent pattern between ACE2 blockage and neutralizing potency, but one can speculate that neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes outside the RBM region may be cross-protective but may also be less potent due to the lack of ACE2 blocking activities. In a recent article[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], a SARS-CoV RBD neutralizing antibody CR3022 with an epitope outside the RBM motif was also shown to be non-blocking but cross-binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a relatively low KD of 6.3 nM.",
            "The neutralization mechanism of these non-blocking antibodies is not clear yet. It is known that antibodies targeting the S2 region could block S2 protein\u2019s configuration change and hence interfere with virus entry into host cells. Whether these non-blocking RBD antibodies also interfere with S2 protein\u2019s configuration change remains to be investigated.",
            "In summary, the above findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to human ACE2 with similar affinities and hence may have similar transmissibility. Antibodies targeting the RBM regions may be more potent due to their ACE2 blocking activities but cross-protecting antibodies targeting the RBM regions may be more difficult to obtain because of the lower degree of sequence conservation. Antibodies to the more conserved regions outside the RBM motif may possess cross-protective neutralizing activities but may be less potent due to the lack of ACE2 blocking activities. Mechanism of neutralization for the non-blocking RBD antibodies remains to be investigated. Developing potent and cross-protective therapeutic antibodies and vaccines is possible but could be challenging."
