        "abstract": "SUMMARYThe recent emergence of a novel coronavirus associated with an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia (Covid-2019) resulted in infections of more than 72,000 people and claimed over 1,800 lives. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein trimers promote entry into cells and are the main target of the humoral immune response. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 S mediates entry in VeroE6 cells and in BHK cells transiently transfected with human ACE2, establishing ACE2 as a functional receptor for this novel coronavirus. We further demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and other SARS-related CoVs. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor-binding domain, and providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal sera potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into target cells, thereby indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.",

We speculate that the detection of a polybasic cleavage site in the fusion glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 could putatively expand its tropism and/or enhance its transmissibility, compared to SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV isolates, due to the near-ubiquitous distribution of furin-like proteases and their reported effects on other viruses (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKlenk_1994_a\" href=\"#rKlenk_1994_a\">Klenk and Garten, 1994</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMillet_2015_a\" href=\"#rMillet_2015_a\">Millet and Whittaker, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSteinhauer_1999_a\" href=\"#rSteinhauer_1999_a\">Steinhauer, 1999</a>). hACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 S.

            "The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus associated with an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia (Covid-2019) resulted in infections of more than 72,000 people and claimed over 1,800 lives. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein trimers promote entry into cells and are the main target of the humoral immune response. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 S mediates entry in VeroE6 cells and in BHK cells transiently transfected with human ACE2, establishing ACE2 as a functional receptor for this novel coronavirus. We further demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and other SARS-related CoVs. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor-binding domain, and providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal sera potently inhibited SARS-CoV-"

To assess the ability of SARS-CoV-2 S to promote entry into target cells, we first compared transduction of SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV and SARS-CoV S-MLV into VeroE6 cells, that are known to express ACE2 and support SARS-CoV replication (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDrosten_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rDrosten_et+al_2003_a\">Drosten et al, 2003</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKsiazek_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rKsiazek_et+al_2003_a\">Ksiazek et al, 2003</a>). Both pseudoviruses entered cells equally well (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV could potentially use African green monkey ACE2 as entry receptor. To confirm these results, we evaluated entry into BHK cells and observed that transient transfection with hACE2 rendered them susceptible to transduction with SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV (Fig. 1 B).

SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong province of China in 2002 and spread to five continents through air travel routes, infecting 8,098 people and causing 774 deaths. In 2012, MERS-CoV emerged in the Arabian Peninsula, where it remains a major public health concern, and was exported to 27 countries, infecting a total of ~2,494 individuals and claiming 858 lives. A previously unknown coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China and was sequenced and isolated by January 2020 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\">Zhou et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhu_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhu_et+al_2020_a\">Zhu et al, 2020</a></a>). SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia (Covid-2019) that has affected over 72,436 people and killed more than 1,868 of them in 29 countries as of February 15th 2020.

The SARS-CoV-2 SB engages human ACE2 (hACE2) with comparable affinity than SARSCoV SB from viral isolates associated with the 2002-2003 epidemic (i.e. binding with high affinity to hACE2). Tight binding to hACE2 could explain the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, as was the case for SARS-CoV. We identified the presence of an unexpected furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 S, which is cleaved during biosynthesis, a novel feature setting this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoVs. Abrogation of this cleavage motif moderately affected SARS-CoV-2 Smediated entry into VeroE6 or BHK cells but may contribute to expand the tropism of this virus, as reported for several highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and pathogenic Newcastle disease virus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKlenk_1994_a\" href=\"#rKlenk_1994_a\">Klenk and Garten, 1994</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSteinhauer_1999_a\" href=\"#rSteinhauer_1999_a\">Steinhauer, 1999</a>).

To assess the ability of SARS-CoV-2 S to promote entry into target cells, we first compared transduction of SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV and SARS-CoV S-MLV into VeroE6 cells, that are known to express ACE2 and support SARS-CoV replication (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDrosten_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rDrosten_et+al_2003_a\">Drosten et al, 2003</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKsiazek_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rKsiazek_et+al_2003_a\">Ksiazek et al, 2003</a>). Both pseudoviruses entered cells equally well (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV could potentially use African green monkey ACE2 as entry receptor. To confirm these results, we evaluated entry into BHK cells and observed that transient transfection with hACE2 rendered them susceptible to transduction with SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrate hACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in agreement with recently reported findings (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHoffmann_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rHoffmann_et+al_2020_a\">Hoffmann et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLetko_2020_a\" href=\"#rLetko_2020_a\">Letko and Munster, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\">Zhou et al, 2020</a>).",
            "Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S reveals the presence of a four amino acid residue insertion at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits compared to SARSCoV S and SARSr-CoV S (Fig. 1 C). This results in the introduction of a furin cleavage site, a feature conserved among the 103 SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced to date but not in the closely related RaTG13 S (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\">Zhou et al, 2020</a>). Using Western blot analysis, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 S was virtually entirely processed at the S1/S2 site during biosynthesis in HEK293T cells, presumably by furin in the Golgi compartment (Fig. 1 D). This observation contrasts with SARS-CoV S which was incorporated into pseudovirions largely uncleaved (Fig. 1 D). To study the influence on pseudovirus entry of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 furin cleavage site, we designed an S mutant lacking the four amino acid residue insertion and the furin cleavage site by mutating Q686TNSPRRAR\u2193SV696 (wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S) to Q686TILR\u2193SV692 (SARS-CoV-2",
            "Sfur/mut). SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut preserves only the conserved Arg residue at position 994 of wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S thereby mimicking the S1/S2 cleavage site of the related SARSr-CoV S CZX21 (Fig. 1 D). SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut is therefore expected to undergo processing at the S1/S2 site upon encounter of a target cell, similarly to SARS-CoV S and SARSr-CoV S (i.e. via TMPRSS2 and/or cathepsin L). As expected, SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut-MLV harbored uncleaved S upon budding (Fig. 1 D). The observed transduction efficiency of VeroE6 cells was higher for SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut-MLV than for SARS-CoV2 S-MLV Fig. 1 A) whereas the opposite trend was observed for transduction of hACE2expressing BHK cells (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that S1/S2 cleavage during S biosynthesis was not necessary for S-mediated entry in the conditions of our experiments (Fig. 1 C-D). We speculate that the detection of a polybasic cleavage site in the fusion glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 could putatively expand its tropism and/or enhance its transmissibility, compared to SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV isolates, due to the near-ubiquitous distribution of furin-like proteases and their reported effects on other viruses (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKlenk_1994_a\" href=\"#rKlenk_1994_a\">Klenk and Garten, 1994</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMillet_2015_a\" href=\"#rMillet_2015_a\">Millet and Whittaker, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSteinhauer_1999_a\" href=\"#rSteinhauer_1999_a\">Steinhauer, 1999</a>) .",

            "To understand the contribution of receptor interaction to the infectivity of SARSCoV-2, we characterized engagement of hACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB side-by-side. We used biolayer interferometry to study binding kinetics and affinity of the purified hACE2 ectodomain to SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB immobilized at the surface of biosensors. We found that hACE2 bound to SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB with respective equilibrium dissociation constants of 2.9 nM (Fig. 2 A) and 7.7 nM (Fig. 2 B), and comparable kinetic rate constants although the off-rate was slightly higher for SARS-CoV SB (Table 1). Previous structural work identified 14 positions that are key for binding of SARS-CoV SB to hACE2: T402, R426, Y436, Y440, Y442, L472, N473, Y475, N479, Y484, T486, T487, G488 and Y491 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2005_a\">Li et al, 2005a</a>).

The conservation of many key contact residues could explain the similar binding affinities of SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB for hACE2. No mutations of residues predicted to contact hACE2 have been observed among SARS-CoV-2 S sequences available to date. However, we note that SARSr-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45, which harbor the most closely related S sequences after SARSr-CoV RaTG13, comprise two deletions in the RBD that could affect binding to hACE2 (between SARSCoV-2 S residues 482-489 and 494-499) (Fig. S 1). Collectively, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is at least as well adapted to the hACE2 orthologue as the 2002-2003 epidemic strains of SARS-CoV, which could explain the efficient transduction efficiency mediated by their respective S glycoproteins (Fig. 1 A-B) and the current rapid SARSCoV-2 transmission in humans.",

            "CoV-2 S comprise 22 N-linked glycosylation sequons per protomer and 16 of them are resolved in the cryoEM map (Fig. 4).

Specifically, 9 out of 13 glycans in the S1 subunit and all 9 glycans in the S2 subunit are conserved among SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S. Furthermore, S2 oligosaccharides are mostly conserved across SARSr-CoV S glycoproteins, suggesting that accessibility of the fusion machinery to antibodies will be comparable among these viruses.",
            "Mapping of the sequence conservation across multiple sarbecovirus S sequences underscores that the S2 fusion machinery is more conserved than the S1 subunit with the highest divergence found within SA and SB (Fig. 5A-B). These observations are in line with (i) the fact that some, but not all of these viruses use ACE2 as entry receptor (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGe_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rGe_et+al_2013_a\">Ge et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRen_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rRen_et+al_2008_a\">Ren et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2015_a\">Yang et al, 2015a</a>); and (ii) that the S1 subunit is more exposed at the viral surface than the fusion machinery, and is likely to be subject to a more stringent selection pressure from the immune system.",
            "Based on these observations, we hypothesized that exposure to one of the two viruses could elicit cross-reactive and potentially neutralizing antibodies against the other virus. We therefore investigated the ability of plasma from four mice immunized with a stabilized SARS-CoV S to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S- and SARS-CoV S-mediated entry into target cells. All sera tested completely inhibited transduction of SARS-CoV SMLV and reduced SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV transduction to ~10% of control in VeroE6 cells (Fig. 5C). The elicitation of a heterotypic response blocking SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into host cells concurs with the sequence and structural conservation of SARSCoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S along with their comparable glycans shields, and suggests that immunity against one virus of the sarbecovirus subgenus can potentially provide protection against related viruses.",
            "Receptor recognition is the first step of viral infection and is a key determinant of host cell and tissue tropism. Enhanced binding affinity between SARS-CoV S and hACE2 was proposed to correlate with increased virus transmissibility and disease severity in humans (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2005_c\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2005_c\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2005_c\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2005_c\">Li et al, 2005c</a></a>). Indeed, SARS-CoV isolates from the three phases of the 2002-2003 epidemic were more efficiently transmitted among humans and more pathogenic than the isolates associated with the 2003-2004 re-emergence that caused only a few cases, in line with their binding affinities for hACE2 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cConsortium_2004_a\" href=\"#rConsortium_2004_a\">Consortium, 2004</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKan_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rKan_et+al_2005_a\">Kan et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2005_c\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2005_c\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2005_c\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2005_c\">Li et al, 2005c</a></a>).

            "Besides binding to host cell receptors, priming of the S glycoprotein by host proteases through cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2\u2019 sites is another crucial factor modulating tropism and pathogenicity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMillet_2015_a\" href=\"#rMillet_2015_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMillet_2015_a\" href=\"#rMillet_2015_a\">Millet and Whittaker, 2015</a></a>).

Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 S harbors a furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary, which is processed during biosynthesis. The presence of a furin cleavage site sets SARS-CoV-2 S apart from SARS-CoV S (and SARSr-CoV S) that possesses a monobasic S1/S2 cleavage site processed upon entry of target cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBelouzard_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rBelouzard_et+al_2009_a\">Belouzard et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBosch_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rBosch_et+al_2008_a\">Bosch et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGlowacka_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rGlowacka_et+al_2011_a\">Glowacka et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMatsuyama_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rMatsuyama_et+al_2010_a\">Matsuyama et al, 2010</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMillet_2015_a\" href=\"#rMillet_2015_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMillet_2015_a\" href=\"#rMillet_2015_a\">Millet and Whittaker, 2015</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShulla_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rShulla_et+al_2011_a\">Shulla et al, 2011</a>).

As the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV SB domains share 75% amino acid sequence identity, future work will be necessary to evaluate how many of these antibodies neutralize the newly emerged coronavirus. These findings also indicate that it might be difficult to distinguish exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from other SARSr-CoVs in serological studies using S ectodomain trimers and that specific assays will need to be designed. Our results provide a structural framework to identify conserved and accessible epitopes across S glycoproteins that will support ongoing vaccine design efforts. Finally, elicitation of diverse, polyclonal Ab responses might prove key in light of the diversity of viruses circulating in animal reservoirs and to prevent the possible emergence of viral neutralization escape mutants."
