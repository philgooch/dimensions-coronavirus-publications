Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy.\nMethods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay.\nResults: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001).\nConclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.",

        "Discussion": [
            "Adequate specimen collection is important for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] At present, the sample collection for viral nucleic acid detection of suspected patients with COVID-19 is mostly upper respiratory tract samples (mainly throat swabs).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] The collection of throat swabs is not standardized and it is easy to miss the diagnosis. The collection process is extremely risky for medical staff.",
            "Sputum is representative of the lower respiratory tract but is rarely used for viral testing. The aim of this study was to compare the detection rates of 2019-nCoV RNA from throat swabs and sputum specimens using the qRT-PCR assay.",
            "In our research, most of the patients were middle-aged and elderly men, which was similar to previous studies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 52 subjects. The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. The present study found that the overall positive rate from sputum specimens in adults was significantly higher than that from throat swabs using qRT-PCR assay. This finding was consistent with the result of a previous study that sputum showed a significantly higher positive rate than nasopharyngeal swabs in detecting respiratory viruses.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Falsey et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] also proved that sputum samples showed higher diagnostic yields than nose\u2013throat swabs in adults.",
            "The detection rate of 2019-nCoV from sputum samples was higher than that from throat swabs, which may be related to novel coronavirus's main invasion and infection of lower respiratory tract cells , resulting in clinical manifestations such as cough and pneumonia. In addition, several studies have shown that respiratory viruses were increasingly recognized as the cause of lower respiratory tract infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] In these cases, specimens of the lower respiratory tract should be collected for detection of 2019-nCoV. And caution should be taken when using the negative result of viral nucleic acid from throat swabs as the criterion for the exclusion of infection and conformation of cure.",
            "It should be noted that the high viscosity of sputum can make it difficult to extract nucleic acid. Therefore, pre-treatment of sputum samples is required, but currently no standardized pre-treatment procedure is available for virus detection. In our study, acetylcysteine was used for the digestion of sputum, which may cause substantial loss of RNA due to the washing and pipetting steps in the procedures.",
            "Therefore, thoroughly mixing and homogenization of sputum samples might be important factors to obtain reliable test results.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]",
            "COVID-19 were included, and further studies were needed to investigate the observation in a larger group of patients. Second, our study only involved throat swabs and sputum samples, and expand discussions of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood samples are necessary in the future. Although sputum is more sensitive than throat swabs for 2019-nCoV detection, the use of sputum may be limited because not all patients with COVID-19 produce sputum, especially elderly patients. Therefore, if a sputum sample is available, it might be a rather reliable specimen for nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV.",
            "In conclusion, the detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than those from throat swabs using the qRT-PCR assay. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of novel coronavirus in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis of COVID-19."
