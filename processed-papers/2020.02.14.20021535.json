        "abstract": "Background:A Novel pneumonia associated with the 2019 coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) suddenly broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 37287 confirmed cases and 813 death case in China (Until 8th/Feb/2019) have been reported in just fortnight. Although this risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolved immediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not be established. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\nMethods: Literature have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger test. In the single-arm meta-analysis, A fix-effects model was used to obtain a pooled incidence rate. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region and research scale.\nResults: A total of nine studies including 356 patients were included in this study, the mean age was 52.4 years and 221 (62.1%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of symptoms as follows: pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), diarrhea (9.2%, 95% CI: 0.062-0.133) and headache (8.9%, 95% CI: 0.063-0.125). Meanwhile, 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) of patients were found without any symptoms although they were diagnosed by RT-PCR. In the terms of CT imaging examination, the most of patients showed bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, 8.6% (95% CI: 0.048-0.148) of patients with crazy-paving pattern, and 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197) of patients without obvious CT imaging presentations. The pooled incidence of mortality was 8.9% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126).\nConclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine research to further elaborate the clinical characteristics of NCIP, which is beneficial to the next step of prevention and treatment.",

        "introduction": [
            "NCIP. The pooled incidence rate of this normal CT imagint was 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197), significant heterogeneity was presented (I2 = 67.16%, P = 0.002). In subgroup analysis, heterogeneity was decreased, indicated that the heterogeneity may come from the geographic region (I2 = 14.62%, P = 0.279) and study scale (I2 = 47.05%, P = 0.079) (Table 4, Figure 2,3). Oxygen therapy Nearly all the patients accepted oxygen therapy. Among these studies, there were 268 patients who used nasal cannula for 2-25 days, the pooled incidence was 74.4% (95% CI: 0.696-0.788) for all studies. 22.8% (95% CI: 0.186-0.275) patients used mechanical ventilation to assist ventilation, the inhaled oxygen concentration was 35-100%. Moreover, 12 patients were treated with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the pooled incidence was 4.6% (95% CI: 0.027-0.077). (Table 2). There was no evidence of heterogeneity and publication bias. The results of subgroup analysis according to geographic region and study scale are presented in Table 3. Clinical outcomes Unfortunately, 26 died cases were reported, the pooled incidence of mortality was 78.1% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126), there was no significant heterogeneity (I2=39.64%, P=0.569). Since the course of treatment of NCIP is about three weeks until some articles published, some patients still accepted therapy in the hospital, the statistics on mortality may be inaccurate (Table 2). There was significant heterogeneity in the ARDS group (I2 = 60.76%, P = 0.01). We found no identifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis (Table 3). DISCUSSION In our research, the number of male patients more than female patients (62.1% vs 37.9%). This result is consistent with the gender distribution of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV13,14. Meanwhile, Chen et.al also showed 2019-nCoV infection is more likely to affect males[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. The reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections could be attributed to the protection from X chromosome and s sex-specific effects in infectious disease susceptibility[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. On the contrary, a recent report that showed there was no difference in the proportion of men and women between ICU patients and non-ICU patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Although the mechanism of this difference cannot be explained at present, male patients should be paid more attention."
