        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nThe ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. \nMETHODS:\nA long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen.\nRESULTS:\nAnti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. Patients treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those without.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV.",

The cohort was divided into two groups to assess the effect of corticosteroid use on IgG titers in 2003. Of the 32 SARS-CoV-infected patients (with 2 cases excluded as suspected to have been misdiagnosed), medical records were available for 27 patients, and the records showed that 17 of these patients were, and the rest were not, treated with corticosteroids during the initial care for SARS in the 2002-2003 outbreak (Table S6).

            "SARS was first confirmed in Guangdong, China in 2003, and subsequently became a pandemic as it spread rapidly to other countries and regions. Cases from Guangdong accounted for nearly 20% of reported cases and approximately 17% of reported healthcare worker cases worldwide. Healthcare workers, in particular, were exposed to an extremely high risk in combating SARS due to limited knowledge of the etiology and other natures of",

            "SARS-CoV may provide important clues, aiding our responses to the outbreak.",
            "IgG antibodies are proven to be important for virus neutralization and immunological protection. As the first sampling of sera was performed during the early stage of SARS, it was not possible to determine the maximum antibody titer, as this would be expected to occur approximately 4 months after the onset of the outbreak.19 Knowledge of the persistence and level of antibodies against SARS-CoV, particularly neutralizing antibodies, is important for evaluating the immune protection duration and vaccine efficacy.

            "We found that the SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers who were treated with corticosteroids, such as prednisone and methylprednisolone, exhibited lower IgG titers during the early stages of the disease than those who were not treated with corticosteroids (although not significantly for IgG against N199). However, no differences were found between the two groups after 2003, suggesting that corticosteroids may suppress the early production of",

Specifically, atypical pneumonia, as it was commonly known prior to adoption of the SARS nomenclature, could also be caused by other pathogens.22 Based on the results of our current 13-year serological follow-up study, it is possible that the two healthcare workers might have been misdiagnosed. Thus, it warrants further investigation to clarify whether these two subjects were non-responders who did not develop anti-SARS-CoV antibodies at all or simply represented misdiagnosed cases. In the latter scenario, the number of SARS cases in the early stage of 2002-2003 SARS outbreak may need to be reassessed. Presently, for the",
            "2019-nCoV outbreak, nucleic acid-based assay and particular real time PCR, are the mainstream methods for etiological diagnosis.

            "During the SARS outbreak, the typical SARS patients mainly presented with antibodies positive for SARS-CoV, fever, and symptoms of respiratory tract infections. Additionally, there was a small group of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-nfected subjects, who only presented with antibodies positive for SARS-CoV, but showed an absence of clinical symptoms.23-25. In this study, we found that four subjects had an abnormal increase in the titers of SARS-CoV antibodies during the follow-up. In contrast, the titers of SARS-CoV antibodies in most of the other healthcare workers appeared to decrease slowly. It is unclear if these four healthcare workers were reinfected with SARS-CoV or other coronaviruses with no signs or symptoms.",
            "Thus, further investigation is needed to clarify whether these healthcare workers elicited IgG response by SARS-CoV or other coronaviruses. In the former situation, the novel mechanism of IgG generation without the clinical SARS symptoms needs to be elucidated.",
            "Although IgG against SARS-CoV declined from 2003 to 2015 gradually, IgG levels in",
            "SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers were significantly higher than those in the non-infected healthcare workers control group in 2015. The infected cases enrolled into the study in 2015, exhibited detectable IgG against whole virus, and the positive rate was ~60%.",
            "For IgG against N199, the positive rate was ~30% in 2015. Moreover, results of the exponential decay curve revealed that IgG antibodies against the whole virus were positive throughout the 13-year follow-up, while IgG antibodies against N199 were negative only in",
            "Collectively, based on our results, we can infer that the IgG against SARS-CoV can persist at least for 12 years. Presently, we are unaware whether the persistent IgG antibodies possess virus neutralization activities and can provide complete protection against SARS-CoV infection or cross protection against the new betacoronavirus, 2019-nCoV. From previous studies, we predicted that the presence of IgG antibodies could at least provide a partial protection against coronavirus infection.
