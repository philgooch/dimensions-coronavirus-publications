        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\uff1aSince December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\uff08SARS-CoV-2\uff09-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019\uff0cCOVID-19) emerged in Wuhan , China\uff0cand rapidly spread throughout China\uff0ceven throughout the world. We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan area\uff0cand explore its effective treatment. \nMethods\uff1aRetrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020\uff1bThe discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients).\nResults\uff1a Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43\uff0884.3%\uff09patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan\uff0cand 4\uff087.7%\uff09 patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4\uff087.7%\uff09 patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])\uff0cLocal consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])\uff0call of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])\uff0cmost of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P &lt;0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13).\nConclusion\uff1aIn 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and asthenia\uff0cSome patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment.",

The rapid spread of close contact between people is an important feature of COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], which requires close monitoring to prevent further large-scale spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.

            "On the first day of admission, the decrease of lymphocyte count was more common (26 [51.0%]); the majority of leukocytes and neutrophils were in the normal range; most patients (32 [62.7%]) had an increase of CRP; some patients had an increase of LDH (20 [39.2%]), D-dimer (10 [19.6%]), IL-6 (16 [31.4%]) and PCT (25 [49%]); and urine routine urine protein was positive in 8 cases. Compared with the non-severe patients, the lymphocyte count decreased more significantly in the severe patients, the serum albumin level was lower, and the LDH, CRP, D-dimer and PCT levels were significantly higher.

The lesions increased in 1(2%) case, no significant change in 4 (8%)cases, and decreased in 45 (90%)cases.

However, no effective outcomes were observed.There is no clear evidence that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection will benefit from hormone therapy and are more likely to face the risks of hormone therapy.

            "( ) Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine TCM treatment may be a useful choice. Although Western medicine is currently used in many Eastern countries as a mainstream medicine, Chinese medicine also plays an important role against various diseases. As we know, to reach a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of Chinese medicine in any specific disease, controlled clinical trials are needed. Moreover, for a devastating epidemic outbreak like SARS, only retrospective study reports can be found [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Chinese medicine may also have a role in the prevention of acute and critical diseases like the SARS virus. Chinese medicine was used as adjuvant therapy ( in the SARS patients.

In this study, only one critically ill patient (dead patient) needs invasive mechanical ventilation, which is lower than previous studies in Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Due to the shortage of early medical resources in Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], this may be related to the serious condition of inpatients in Wuhan.",
            "This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is small, especially in severe patients. Second, the majority of discharged patients are non-severe patients. Severe and critically ill patients often have more complications and may require longer hospital stays. Most are still in hospital. Third, there are four COVID-19 treatment centers in Chongqing, and there is still no relevant comparative analysis. Conclusions",
            "In the case analysis of 51 discharged patients of COVID-19 in the single center of Northeast Chongqing, most of the infected patients were young and middle-aged, and most of them were imported cases. Most cases have typical symptoms such as fever and cough, and a few cases have atypical symptoms such as diarrhea. The changes of CRP and other inflammatory indexes may be related to the severity of the disease. Traditional Chinese medicine provides an alternative for the treatment of COVID-19."
