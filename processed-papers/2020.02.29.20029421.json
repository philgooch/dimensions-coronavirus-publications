        "abstract": "We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.",

            "<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong><br/><br/>We develop an epidemiological forecast model with an R software package to assess effects of interventions on the COVID-19 epidemic within Hubei and outside Hubei in China. Since our proposed model utilizes the strength of the SIR\u2019s dynamic system to capture the primary mechanism of the COVID-19 infectious disease, we are able to predict future episodes of the disease spread patterns over a window of 200 days from the last date of data availability. Some turning points of interest are obtained from these forecasting curves as part of the deliverable information, including the predicted time when daily proportion of infected cases becomes smaller than the previous ones and the predicted time when daily proportion of removed cases (i.e. both recovered and dead) becomes larger than that of infected cases, as well as the time when the epidemic ends. Our informatics toolbox provides quantification of uncertainty on the prediction, rather than only point prediction values, which are valuable to see the best versus the worst. The key novel contribution is the incorporation of time-varying quarantine protocols to expand the basic epidemiological model to accommodate changing transmission rates over time in the population. The toolbox can be used by practitioners who have better knowledge of quarantine and better quality data to perform their own analyses. Practitioners can use the toolbox to evaluate different types of quarantine strategies in practice. All summary statistics obtained from the toolbox are of great importance for public health workers and government policy makers to take proper actions on stop spreading of COVID-19."

This epidemic has been concerning not only in China but also in the rest of the world given the currently fast growing number of infected cases in South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy.",
            "In addition to vaccination, quarantine or medical isolation is the human wisdom that has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to stop the spreading of infectious diseases such as SARS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] and plague [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] in the human history.

In the meantime, the Chinese government has quickly increased the capacity of hospitals or as such that took symptomatic patients to be quarantined and treated by medical doctors and nurses, most of whom were dispatched from hospitals outside of Hubei province.",
            "The question of the most importance, which draws most attention, concerns when the spread of COVID-19 will end. This question has to be answered by a prediction model using the daily most-updated data from the China CDC. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data, which are thought to be inaccurate due to the issue of under-reporting. Many prediction models [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] have already been proposed to provide good fitting results for the publicly available data that may be potentially under-reported. Each of these models may result in different predictions of turning points, such as the dates when the daily increased or the total number of infections begin to decrease. Since such forecasting needs to extrapolate a fitted model to a relatively distance future time after the last date with observed data, whichever the chosen model is used, the model itself will dictate prediction results. Many tuning methods have been developed by data scientists to tune a prediction model, producing only point predictions with no quantification of prediction uncertainty. In addition, data accuracy, in particular the issue of under-reporting, may cause bias in prediction, and ignoring this issue would lead to an optimistic prediction of early turning points. The issue of under-reporting may be attributed to the unsatisfactory sensitivity of the RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 or to the lack of enough kits for testing at the beginning of the outbreak among other logistic and political reasons. The Chinese government tried to correct these issues by using a new diagnostic protocol based on clinical symptoms starting at the first week of February. However, it undermines the quality of data collected in the early phase of the epidemic.",
            "All the above points illustrate the complexity of human interventions on the spread of COVID19, including but not limited to in-home quarantine, hospitalization, community enforcement of wearing masks, minimizing outdoor activities, and changed diagnostic criteria by the government. The prediction model must take such features into account in order to provide meaningful analyses and hopefully reasonable predictions. However, most existing prediction models do not have the capacity to incorporate changing interventions in reality, and with no such critical component of time-varying intervention in the model, predicted turning points would be untrustworthy. Our new model and analytic toolbox aim to fill in this significant gap.",
            "We develop a health informatics toolbox, with an R package eSIR [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], that helps accomplish the following specific aims: AIM 1 : Utilize and calibrate publicly available data to understand the epidemiological trend of",

            "AIM 2 : Incorporate time-varying quarantine protocols in the model of COVID-19 infection dynamics via an extension of the classical epidemiological SIR model. This dynamic infection system necessitates the forecast of the future trend of COVID-19 spread.",
            "AIM 3 : Provide an R software package to health workers who can conveniently perform their own analyses using their substantive knowledge and perhaps better quality data from provinces in China or from other countries.",
            "By no means the toolbox developed by us would give an accurate prediction of turning points, but rather we hope to provide a data analytic toolbox to people who may have better domain-specific knowledge and experience as well as high quality data to carry out independent predictions.",
            "Our informatics toolbox is built upon a state-space model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] shown in Figure 1 with an extended Markov SIR model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], which has the following key features: (i) Our model is specified with the temporally varying prevalence of susceptible, infected and removed (recovered and death) compartments, not directly on time series of respective counts; (ii) estimation and inference are carried out and implemented by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm; (iii) it outputs various sample draws from the posteriors of the model parameters (e.g. transmission and removal rates) and the underlying prevalence of susceptible, infected and removed compartments, as well as their credible intervals. The latter is of extreme importance to quantify prediction uncertainty. In addition, this toolbox provides predicted turning points, including (i) the date when daily increased number of infections begins to decrease or the time at which the second order derivative of the prevalence of infected compartment is zero (i.e. the turning point of infection acceleration to deceleration); and (ii) the date when daily number of removed cases is larger than that of infected cases, or the time at which the first derivative of the prevalence of infected compartment is zero (i.e. the turning point of zero infection speed). As a byproduct, the method also provides a predicted time when the COVID-19 epidemic ends.",

Section 2 presents our new epidemiological forecast model incorporating timevarying quarantine protocols. Section 3 concerns the algorithmic implementation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo and a deliverable R software. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of COVID-19 data within and outside Hubei, where a calibration of under-reporting is proposed. Section 5 gives some concluding remarks, and some technical details are included in the appendices."

        "2.1 Basic model of coronavirus infection": [
            "We begin with a basic epidemiological model in the framework of state-space SIR models with no consideration of quarantine protocols. This framework was proposed by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] with only onedimensional time series of infected proportions. Refer to Chapter 9-12 of [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] for an introduction to state-space models. Here we consider two time series of proportions of infected and removed cases, denoted by YtI and YtR at time t, respectively, where the compartment of removed R is a sum of the proportions of recovered cases and deaths at time t. We assume that the 2-dimensional time series of pYtI , YtRqJ follows a state-space model with the beta distributions at time t: YtI |\u03b8t, \u03c4 \u201e Betap\u03bbI \u03b8tI , \u03bbI p1  \u0301 \u03b8tI qq,",
            "where \u03b8tI and \u03b8tR are the respective prevalence of infection and removal at time t, and \u03bbI and \u03bbR are the parameters controlling the respective variances of the observed proportions.",
            "As shown in Figure 1, these observed time series are emitted from the underlying latent dynamics of COVID-19 infection characterized by the latent Markov process \u03b8t. It is easy to see that the expected proportions in both models (1) and (2) are equal to the prevalence of infection and the probability of removal at time t, namely EpYtI |\u03b8tq \u201c \u03b8tI and EpYtR|\u03b8tq \u201c \u03b8tR. See Appendix B. Moreover, the latent population prevalence \u03b8t \u201c p\u03b8tS, \u03b8tI , \u03b8tRqJ is a three-dimensional Markov process, in which \u03b8tS is the probability of a person being susceptible or at risk at time t, \u03b8tI is the probability of a person being infected at time t, and \u03b8tR is the probability of a person being removed from the infectious system (either recovered or dead) at time t. Obviously, \u03b8tS\u03b8tI\u03b8tR \u201c 1.

In addition, the virus itself may mutate to evolve, so to increase the potential rate of false negative in the disease diagnosis. As a result, some individual virus carriers are not contained. Thus, the transmission rate \u03b2 indeed varies over time, which should be accounted in the modeling.",

It is shown in Figure 8 that on Feb 12 the cumulative and daily added number of infected cases in Hubei had clear jumps with significantly large sizes. Such sizable jumps cannot happen within one day, rather they represent an accumulation of cases that have not been reported in previous dates prior to Feb 12.

When Panel A in Figure 12 is zoomed in, some of the observed proportions (black dots) are deviated from the posterior mean or median of the fitted prevalence albeit they all fall in the 95% credible intervals, as shown by Panel A in Figures 13 and 14.

As described in Subsection 4.1, we corrected the under-reported proportion of infections in Hubei province prior to Feb 12, when a big jump occurred on one day. We repeated the same analyses using the calibrated data of infections, and the corresponding results are shown in Figures 18-21. It is interesting to see that the abrupt rise in the infection proportion on Feb 12 disappeared in all Panel A in these new analyses, and the observed data (i.e. the black dots) align better with the",
            "Model No quarantine Exponential Step-function Quar. Compart.",
            "credible intervals of all the latent processes. We also notice that after the correction, the estimated reproduction numbers R0 became smaller. The reproduction numbers estimated from different models for within and outside Hubei, with and without the data calibration, together with their 95% credible intervals are summarized in Table 1.",
            "It is worth pointing out that the estimates of the reproduction numbers obtained from the epidemiological models with time-varying transmission or quarantine rates appear larger than those obtained from the basic model with no quarantine. This is no surprising as our new models explicitly incorporate interventions, so that the estimated R0 is an adjusted number with the influence of interventions be removed. In contrast, the basic model with no use of the quarantine modifier implicitly integrates the effect of interventions into the transmission rate \u03b2, and consequently the estimated R0 is reduced due to the contribution from interventions. Our analyses suggest that reproduction numbers R0 of COVID-19 without public health interventions would be around 4-5 within Hubei and around 3-3.5 outside Hubei with relatively big credible intervals. These findings are in agreement with findings from [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. As pointed out above, the size of credible interval may be reduced with more accessible data of COVID-19, which permit users to specify smaller variances in the prior distributions given in section 3.1."
        ],
        "5 Concluding Remarks": [
            "We develop an epidemiological forecast model with an R software package to assess effects of interventions on the COVID-19 epidemic within Hubei and outside Hubei in China. Since our",
            "proposed model utilizes the strength of the SIR\u2019s dynamic system to capture the primary mechanism of the COVID-19 infectious disease, we are able to predict future episodes of the disease spread patterns over a window of 200 days from the last date of data availability. Some turning points of interest are obtained from these forecasting curves as part of the deliverable information, including the predicted time when daily proportion of infected cases becomes smaller than the previous ones and the predicted time when daily proportion of removed cases (i.e. both recovered and dead) becomes larger than that of infected cases, as well as the time when the epidemic ends. Our informatics toolbox provides quantification of uncertainty on the prediction, rather than only point prediction values, which are valuable to see the best versus the worst. The key novel contribution is the incorporation of time-varying quarantine protocols to expand the basic epidemiological model to accommodate changing transmission rates over time in the population. The toolbox can be used by practitioners who have better knowledge of quarantine and better quality data to perform their own analyses. Practitioners can use the toolbox to evaluate different types of quarantine strategies in practice. All summary statistics obtained from the toolbox are of great importance for public health workers and government policy makers to take proper actions on stop spreading of COVID-19.",
            "We chose the MCMC algorithm to implement the statistical estimation and prediction because of the consideration on the prediction uncertainty. Given the considerable complexity in the COVID19 virus spread dynamics and potentially inaccurate information of quarantine measures as well as likely under-reported proportions of infected and recovered cases and deaths, it is of critical importance to quantify and report uncertainty in the forecast. Note that the publicly reported data of recovery and death of COVID-19 are mostly collected from hospitals where accessibility to such information is warrant. In contrast, it is very difficulty, if not impossible, to collect the data of infected individuals with light symptoms who had in-home isolation and recovered, in spite of serious efforts made by the government for a door-to-door inspection to identify suspected cases.",
            "This toolbox is indeed so general that it may be applicable to analyze and evaluate the COVID19 epidemic in other countries, as well as the future outbreak of other types of infectious diseases. As noted in the paper, our proposed method does need prior data of similar infectious disease to set up initial conditions of the infection dynamics. For this, we analyzed the complete SARS data from Hong Kong given some similarity of COVID-19 to SARS. From this perspective, what we learned from this COVID-19 epidemic in this paper is extremely valuable to form initial conditions in the analysis of any future outbreak of similar infectious disease. In addition, understanding forms and strengths of quarantines for the controlling of disease spread is an inevitable path to making effective preventive policies, which is the key analytic capacity that our toolbox offers.",
            "The proposed epidemiological models can be further extended to accommodate more data reported by the China CDC, which are worth future exploration. Two types of data that may be used in the future extension are the daily number of suspected cases and the daily number of hospitalized cases. We did not use such data due to the concern of data accuracy. For example, the number of suspected cases is largely dependent on the diagnostic protocols, which have been revised a few times since the outbreak of the disease, and the sensitivity of the RNA test. Given such concerns, our strategy in the proposed model was to only use necessary data for analysis, and over the course of improved data quality in the near future, our toolbox may be extended to enjoy greater statistical power and more accurate predictions."

Here, t \u201c 1 stands for Jan 13 and t \u201c stands for Feb 12. Under the condition of yp0q \u201c 0, we can easily get that yptq \u201c ae\u03bbta. To estimate parameter \u03bb and a, we want to minimize the least square error of the estimated number yptq of infected cases at t \u201c (Feb 13), which is one day after the Chinese government changed the diagnosis protocol. It is assumed that the difference between the predicted and observed number of infections on Feb 13 would not be big if the model were established well, although the long term difference might be large due to other interventions. Therefore, the optimization problem we want to solve is, min typ32qae32\u03bbau2 a,\u03bb s.t. ae31\u03bba \u201c yp31q. The constraint ae31\u03bba \u201c yp31q is used to ensure that the cumulative number of infected cases till Feb equals to the observed value yp31q.
