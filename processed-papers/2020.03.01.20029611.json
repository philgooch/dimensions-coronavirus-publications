        "abstract": "Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), many researchers in China have immediately carried out clinical research scheme of the COVID-19. But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we made the first systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the control of the COVID-19. Methods: The database from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two evaluators independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. This study is based on the recommendations of PRISMA in Cochrane handbook. Results: A total of 75 COVID-19 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) were obtained. 97.3% of clinical trials were initiated by Chinese organizations. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and all registered clinical trials have not been completed. Most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre-experiment stage (only two trials of Remdesivir in \u2162 stage), and the sample size of subjects recruited is small. The main intervention methods include traditional Chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment. The subjects were mainly non severe adult patients (\u2265 18 years old). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examination. The duration of most trials was more than 5 months, and the median of the intervention study was 180 d (95% CI: 146.3 - 328.9 d); the median of the observation period was 334 d (95% CI: 166.6 - 363.4 d). Overall, both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in China. However, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.",

However, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. In order to effectively deal with the current sudden health emergencies, the National Administration of scientific research should strengthen their management and coordination to improve the study quality based on the guidelines for clinical trials. Also, it is important to ensure that some promising projects are prioritized. In addition, we suggest that using a variety of study designs and statistical methods to scientifically and efficiently conduct the clinical trials, which has an extremely important value for the control of COVID-19."

            "Intervention and comparison The main intervention methods of registered clinical trials include traditional Chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated traditional and Western medicine treatment, etc.; the outcome of treatment observation mainly includes clinical rehabilitation time, the incidence of using mechanical ventilation, the incidence in ICU, mortality, all kinds of complications and virological detection indicators, etc.; the medication methods mainly include oral, injection, atomization inhalation, etc.; the majority of medication time is more than one week. The time limit of outcome observation was more than [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] weeks. The controls were mainly treated with placebo or routine treatment In the registered clinical trials, there are 32 western medicine treatments, and the intervention methods mainly include: i) antiviral drugs, such as: rhetcivir, abidol, fabiravir, chloroquine phosphate, asc09/ritonavir compound tablets, lopinavir/ritonavir (Coriolus), hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, baloxavir, darunavir/Corbis, etutabine/propofol tenofovir, etc.; ii) antiviral drug combination biological agents, for example: lucotinib combined with mesenchymal stem cell therapy, recombinant cytokine-gene derived protein injection combined with abidol or lopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant virus macrophage inflammatory protein for aerosol inhalation injection or lopinavir/ritonavir tablets combined with thymosin A1, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-\u03b12b; iii) biological agents (products), for example: uterine blood stem cells, interferon, cord blood mononuclear cells, cord mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium, recombinant cytokine gene-derived protein, immunoglobulin, etc.; and iv) steroid therapy, for example, glucocorticoid (intervention in critical patients).",
            "There are 22 clinical registration trials treated with traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment drugs are mainly various kinds of compound Chinese herbal medicines (decoction, capsule, granule, etc.), including Feiyanyihao, Qingfeijiedutang, Xinguanyihao, Lianhuaqingwen capsule, etc. The main ingredients are antiviral and immunomodulatory Chinese herbal formulas. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine treatment also involves some injections from herbal extract, such as Shuanghuanglian Injection, Xue-Bi-Jing Injection and Tanreqing Injection.",
            "There are 6 clinical registration trials of the combination of Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and the intervention means is to use the combination of the above Chinese herbs and Western medicine antiviral drugs.",
            "Observation outcomes and measure timing The observation outcomes included: cure rate, cure time, incidence of adverse outcomes, clinical improvement time, ratio of normal progression to severe disease, time to heavy progression, death, virus nucleic acid copies, coronavirus nucleic acid conversion time, pneumonia severity index, Murray lung injury score, chest CT, the survival rate and mortality of patients. Additionally, some laboratory tests novel coronavirus were also selected, including routine blood test, urine routine test, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, muscle enzyme, troponin, myoglobin, D dimer, blood gas analysis, coagulation routine, new coronavirus nucleic acid examination, and T cell subgroup analysis, hospital length etc. The follow-up timing of the outcome measure is mostly [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] weeks, but some studies do not set forth a plan.

Most trials reported randomization, while the other trials had high risk of biases in randomization (17 trials did not mention randomization",
            "; and 6 trials were judged as non-randomized trials) Few trials conducted distribution concealment; only nine trials implemented blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessment; None of the 63 trials clarified drop-out and follow-up bias. However, other bias risks, such as the risk of conflict of interest among drug manufacturers, are unclear.",
            "The NOS scores of the observational trials are from 4 to 6 (Table 3).

Therefore, the overall quality of registered observational trials is low."

        "Discussion": [
            "COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, which is still poorly understood, so there is no recognized effective treatment. This sudden health incident has caused great harm to China and seriously threatened people's health [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. In order to deal with the disease, researchers have carried out many clinical studies intensively. According to the search results, the current studies are concentrated in China, mainly involving the treatment and intervention of traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine and the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Clinical research institutes are mainly hospitals of China. As far as the stage was concerned, most of the studies are still the exploratory research or in pre-experiment stage, and there are nine extended validation studies of the indications of drugs on the market (chloroquine phosphate, abidol, fabiravir, asc09/ritonavir compound tablets, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine), etc., while only two of the three-phase clinical trials. From the perspective of sample size, the intervention trials are small sample studies, hence, the evidence level is low and the clinical significance will be limited.",
            "At present, the treatment of this disease is mainly antiviral, improving patients' immunity, intervening in autoimmune damage (against immune storm caused by cytokines) and symptomatic treatment. According to the in vitro cell test, the antiviral effect of Western drugs is obviously superior to that of traditional Chinese medicine (the concentration value of the inhibitory effect is low). But considering that Chinese herbs have both antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, it has a certain application prospect in disease prevention and treatment; at present, the combination of Chinese and Western Medicine (Qingfeipaidutang and chloroquine phosphate, abidol, lopinavir/Rito) is considered as a better treatment method by experts, and has been listed in \u201cProtocol of Prevention and Control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia\u201d, but there is still a lack of high-quality evidence, which needs clinical verification.",
            "According to the existing preliminary evidence, the antiviral drug Remdesivir (two three-phase clinical trials for light, moderate and heavy patients respectively, expected to end on April 27, 2020) has a promising application prospect. The reasons are as follows: i) cell test results both in vitro and in vivo showed that very low concentration can play an antiviral role24-25; ii) animal test is safe 26; and iii) clinical test is anti-Ebola (the same as new coronavirus) RNA virus is effective [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]; and iv) clinical case report is effective 29. In addition, some of the validation drugs, such as Chloroquine Phosphate, Abidol, Darunavir, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Coriolus Versicolor), have been proved to be safe and have strong antiviral potential in vitro 25. Therefore, these Western antiviral drugs have an application potential and need to be verified in clinical practice.",
            "In this review, we found that many trials used biological products for immunotherapy of the disease. In light of the experience and lessons of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 30-31, steroid therapy has been used cautiously in the treatment of the disease, so there are few trials based on the retrieval results.",
            "From the perspective of inclusion and exclusion criteria, some people were excluded, such as children and adolescents, pregnant women, patients with serious liver and kidney damage. Therefore, this will lead to the lack of clinical evidence in this part of the population.",
            "The outcomes of clinical trial observation includes clinical observation outcomes, physical examination and laboratory test results, but some outcomes are subjective, which may cause measurement bias.",
            "Based on Cochrane risk of bias items and NOS, we evaluated the quality of intervention trials and observational trials, respectively. The evaluation results showed that the overall quality of registered clinical research was low. Therefore, it indicates that most of the registered clinical studies have a greater risk of bias, and the level of evidence is relatively low in the future, which belittles the practice significance of the research. We believed that the main reasons for the low quality of the registered clinical trial protocols are: i) the researchers' clinical research ability is not enough, and ii) the researchers lack experience in dealing with sudden health events.",
            "We believed that it is necessary to improve the quality of research and to the registered clinical research programmes in strict accordance with the guidelines for clinical trials [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>-35]. In addition, current clinical trials by different hospitals conducted spontaneously are not effectively organized and coordinated, so more scattered and disorderly. Some drugs that have not been tested in vitro or whose safety is of great concern are also being tested in clinical trials, which not only increase the risk of clinical trials, but also waste research resources. Hence, the National Administration of scientific research should strengthen their management and coordination and a small number of promising drugs, such as Remdesivir, should be prioritized for clinical trials and allowed to run smoothly.",
            "From these registered clinical studies, we found a serious limitation: most of the registered clinical research did not consider the \"timeliness\", and still followed the conservative traditional study design paradigm. The research duration was more than 5 months, and the median (days) of the intervention research was 180 (95% CI: 146.3 \u2013 328.9), which is very unfavorable for the current urgent situation. We believed that, in the current situation, we should pay more attention to \"timeliness\" in the design of clinical trials (otherwise, the epidemic situation may have ended after drug approval; the research also lost its social significance). Therefore, in response to this emerging public health event, we can refer to the \"sequential design\" for clinical trials; \"sequential design\" not only saves the sample size, but also significantly shortens the research period, so it is very conducive to the screening and discovery of some drugs with significant efficacy [36-37]. In addition, a very difficult problem is the treatment of severe and critical patients with COVID-19. For these patients, we suggested that: based on the \"compassionate use drug\" principle, with safe and obvious antiviral potential drugs, to conduct a staged small batch and single-arm clinical trials is feasible. We believed that \"compassionate use drug\" can not only meet the special needs of patients but also carry out clinical effectiveness observation, research and analysis, so as to improve the research efficiency and benefit patients [38-42]. Also, given a large number of clinical cases have accumulated information, and using available existing data for statistics and analysis with the help of new statistical methods such as clinical data-mining [43-45] and real-world study [46-48], etc., can also quickly obtain some very valuable information and save research time.",
            "In brief, under the condition that there are a large number of cases to be selected at present, it is of great value for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 to try to complete various clinical trial designs and data analysis scientifically and efficiently with a variety of clinical research designs and statistical analysis methods, and researchers should try in future."
        ],
        "Conclusions": [
            "Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in China. However, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. In order to effectively deal with the current sudden health emergencies, the National Administration of scientific research should strengthen their management and coordination to improve the study quality based on the guidelines for clinical trials. Also, it is important to ensure that some promising projects are prioritized. In addition, we suggest that using a variety of study designs and statistical methods to scientifically and efficiently conduct the clinical trials, which has an extremely important value for the control of COVID-19."
