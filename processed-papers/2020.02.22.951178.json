        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the \u03b2-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.",

The distance matrix was calculated based on the Jukes-Cantor methods [25]. The bootstrap values of the phylogenetic tree were derived from 1,000 replicates [26]. 104 Conservation score and epitope mapping of SARS-CoV-2 S protein The conservation score of amino acid positions on S protein in SARS-CoV-2 was calculated by ConSurf program [27]. The multiple sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 strain Wuhan-Hu-1and 12 related strains (Supplementary Table S1) was used as an input for ConSurf. In ConSurf, conservation scores and confidence intervals for the conservation scores were calculated using the empirical Bayesian method. The scores were normalized using the number of inputted sequences. Also, the highest score of ConSurf program means the most conserved position among sequences. We additionally checked the epitope positions on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein based on the known epitope information of 11 neutralizing antibodies developing for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Each information of epitope positions was acquired from literatures (Table 1). 114 Structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein S-RBD protein structure was used cryo-EM structure (Protein Data Bank ID : 6VSB) [15]. To predict the missing region of cryo-EM structure in SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, we performed homology modeling based on known the three dimensional structure of SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6NB7) using SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) [28].

Coronavirus (CoV) has been identified in human and animals including bats, camels, zpigs, cats, and mice. The viruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses in human [1]. Two of betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV)<br/><br/>and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), caused severe epidemics during the last two decades.

The S genes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from initially sequenced 62 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. After removal of identical S gene sequences, 16 genes of S protein were used in the study.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 groups formed a rigid monophyletic group with their own closest bat SARS-CoV related strains, respectively. The result suggested that these two human-pathogenic CoV strains were derived from common ancestral bat CoV. The sequence alignments showed that there were insertions and deletion during the divergence among the strains (Fig. 1B and 1C). Various deletions were observed in SARS-CoV related group.

        "conclusions": [
            "The fact that CoVs similar to SARS in Chinese bats is most identical to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that SARS-CoV may have been originated from a common ancestral bat CoV. Comparing the sequences among the three groups, various deletions were observed in the SARS-CoV related group. Especially, amino acid positions 71-77<br/><br/>(GTNGTKR) in the NTD region of the S protein, 445-449 (VGGNY) and 470-486 (TEIYQAGSTPCNGVEGF)<br/><br/>were noteworthy. The regions were highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2, unlike other SARS-CoVs.<br/><br/>Among the neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, CR3022 was predicted to have better binding affinity to the S-RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 than other antibodies. The comparison of antibody binding region between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was conducted to apply the suitable diagnostic or therapeutic antibodies and vaccines that are mimetics of extremely infectious SARS-CoV-2."

Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that",

ACE2 is a well known host cell receptor for SARS-CoV [12]. Shi and colleges showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor but not other CoV receptors, aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [13].

In ConSurf, conservation scores and confidence intervals for the conservation scores were calculated using the empirical Bayesian method. The scores were normalized using the number of inputted sequences. Also, the highest score of ConSurf program means the most conserved position among sequences. We additionally checked the epitope positions on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein based on the known epitope information of 11 neutralizing antibodies developing for SARS-CoV and",

With the complex structures of RBD and antibody candidates, allatom relax protocol, docking prepack protocol, and antibody-antigen docking simulation were carried out to calculate the free energy of low-energy binding conformations. The distiribution of docking scores displayed as funnel plots using interface RMD (interface RMS) versus the binding score (dG binding) between antibody and antigen (Fig. 4). The binding score was used Rosetta\u2019s docking interface score (based on the Talaris2013 force field) to rank the complexes. Rosetta interface score is defined as Isc = Ebound \u2212 Eunbound, where Ebound is the score of the bound complex and Eunbound is the sum of the scores of the individual protein partners in isolation.
