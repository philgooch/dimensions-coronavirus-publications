        "abstract": "Background:\nAfter the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. \nMethods and findings:\nWe used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6\u00b110 in Wuhan and March 20\u00b116 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly.\nConclusions:\nThe unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.",

            "We simulated the virus transmission process using the SEIR model and estimated the model parameters for Wuhan (Fig. 3) and Beijing (Fig. 4). For Wuhan, we first fit the number of confirmed cases (Fig. 3A), where the R0 is 5.75, much higher than that in most studies yet lower than Tang et al.\u2019s result (Table 1). Due to the reality that a number of infected people in Hubei Province have not been checked [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], we fit a more realistic transmission dynamics, under a condition of a fixed starting day on Dec. 1, 2019 (Fig. 3B). The best fit model having the R0 5.0. After the city closure on Jan. 23, the residents of Wuhan performed strong self-protection by isolating themselves at home, so that we halved basic reproductive number to 2.5, reflecting the pattern of family cluster infection of the virus. Since Feb. 8, a door-todoor check was started in Wuhan in order to take all confirmed and suspected people into medical care, and the transmission between family members dropped greatly. As such, we further decrease the R0 to 1.5. With these transmission rates, the infectious population could reach the peak of 1.75\u00b12.12 x 105 on March 6\u00b110, 2020. The warming climate, based on Equation 2, may shorten the transmission duration by 1-2 months (Fig. 3D).",
            "For Beijing, about half of the infections were directly imported from Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "We assume the infection flow would last for 30 days (from Jan. 19 to Feb. 18), caused by the 10 million people leaving the returning Beijing for holidays. We simulated the numbers of imported cases and found the best fit of daily imported cases for the 30 days following a normal distribution, with mean value and SD to be 19 \u00b112.7 individuals / day. To estimate the fluctuation of this time series of imported cases, we calculated the standard deviation of the mean value (19 individuals / day) of the daily imported patients from Jan. 19 to Feb. 8, which is 3.67. We adopted this uncertainty to run 200 simulation, and found the R0 1.4 is the perfect fit (Fig. 4A). Considering the strict community locking (close to any visitors) and other extreme control measures (such as office building control, i.e. checking body temperature for every one and refusing visitors) in Beijing, we adopted a lower R0 1.2 after the first 30 days of transmission.

The lockdown of Hubei Province substantially decreased the imported infections, ensure the situation being manageable outside the province.",
