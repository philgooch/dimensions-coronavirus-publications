        "abstract": "The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within COVID-19 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage.  A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.",

            "The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge.

            "Human pathogen-derived peptide antigens that are also recognized by C57BL/6 T cells have been previously described.

The existence of such epitopes makes possible a 35 range of pre-clinical vaccine experiments without having to rely on non-human primates and expensive and complex-to-manage humanized mouse models. Wilson et al showed that the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) is an immunogen that provides protective, CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in a C57BL/6 mouse model and that this protection was conferred by a peptide sequence within Ebola 40 Zaire: NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>]. Wilson et al came to this conclusion based on studying splenocytes harvested from mice vaccinated with Ebola Zaire NP using a Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) vector. Their experiments showed that splenocytes from the vaccinated mice re-stimulated with NP43-53 had high levels of cytotoxic activity against target cells loaded with the EBOV 45 NP peptide.

This structural role of NP44-52 likely explains its 180 conservation across EBOV strains.",

Nucleocapisid proteins are essential for EBOV replication [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. Recent advances in T-cell based vaccines have focused on avoiding all variable viral epitopes and incorporating only conserved regions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].

The nucleocapsid proteins in SARS-CoV are also essential for that virus to function normally [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. This suggests that a CTL vaccine targeting coronavirus nucleocapsid could be effective against SARS-CoV or COVID-19.",
            "We have shown that an H2-Db restricted Class I peptide exists within the 190 NP41-60 epitope identified by Sakebe et al as the most commonly favored NP epitope for CD8+ attack by survivors of the 2013-1016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa. We have demonstrated, when delivered in conjunction with a predictedmatched Class II epitope using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine platform, NP44-52 protection against mortality and morbidity for the maEBOV 195 challenge doses tested in a C57BL/6 mouse model. We accomplished this with an adjuvanted, microsphere-based, synthetic CTL peptide vaccine platform producing a protective immune response 14 days after a single administration.",
            "We saw what appears to be an innate immune response at the 10,000 PFU EBOV exposure level. It has been suggested that EBOV can mediate an innate 200 immunity response through stimulation of TLR-4 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Because the adjuvanted microsphere vaccine used in this experiment incorporates a TLR-4 agonist, we dosed 10 mice with adjuvanted microspheres without peptides and found the level of protection after exposure to 100 PFU EBOV to be statistically no different from that seen in PBS buffer controls. We conclude that level of protection 205 conferred by the adjuvanted vaccine described in this study is dependant on delivering peptides with the microspheres.",
            "EBOV can cause severe pulmonary problems in exposed subjects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. These problems can be especially severe when the virus is delivered by aerosol [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Interaction of EBOV specific antibody, NHP lung tissue and EBOV delivered 210 to NHPs via aerosol can produce a more lethal effect than in NHPs without circulating anti-EBOV antibody exposed to aerosolized EBOV (unpublished conference presentation). This suggests that a CTL vaccine may be more effective for prophylaxis against filovirus protection than an antibody vaccine if the anticipated route of EBOV exposure is via aerosol. 215 Sakebe et al identified A*30:01:01 as the only HLA type common to all four survivors in their study with CD8+ targeting of NP41-60. The A*30 supertype is relatively common in West Africa: 13.3% for Mali, 15.4% for Kenya, 16.3% for Uganda, and 23.9% for Mozambique [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Although peptide vaccines are by their nature HLA restricted, it may be possible to create a CTL vaccine 220 directed against EBOV for use alone or in conjunction with a whole protein vaccine to produce an antibody response in tandem, by incorporating additional Class I peptides from epitopes targeted by controllers to broaden the HLA coverage of the vaccine. MHC binding algorithms hosted by the IEDB predict that YQVNNLEEI will bind strongly to the MHC of HLA-A*02:06, HLA-A*02:03 225 and HLA-A*02:01 individuals (Table 5)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. HLA-DR binding database analysis also suggests that VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG demonstrates sufficiently promiscuous binding characteristics cover that same population (Table 7)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. Taken together, a peptide vaccine based on YQVNNLEEI and VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG could produce a cellular immune response in about 50% of 230 the population of the Sudan and about 30% of the population of North America.",
            "This same approach could be applied to COVID-19 which also has conserved regions in nucleocapsid proteins as shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15. Antigenic escape allows a virus to retain fitness despite an immune response to vaccination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Picking conserved regions for vaccine targeting is an important part 235 of mitigating this problem. Coronavirus spike protein, for example, may be particularly susceptible to mutation meaning that antigenic escape would be likely if the spike protein was targeted by a coronavirus vaccine, making it difficult to achieve durable protection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>].",
            "We took all possible 424 9mer peptide sequences from the COVID-19 nu240 cleocapsid protein sequences available and evaluated each peptide for HLA restriction using NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.0 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. We analyzed 9mer peptide sequences because these are often associated with superior MHC binding properties than class I peptides of other lengths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. We found 53 unique peptides with predicted binding below 500nM from NetMHC 4.0 and/or NetMHC245 pan 4.0. These results are shown in Table 9, Table 10, Table 11 and Table 12.",
            "We proceeded to determine the predicted HLA population coverage of a vaccine incorporating all 53 peptides using median values of the ANN, SMM, NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.0 algorithms hosted by IEDB [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. These 53",
            "peptides, taken together, had predicted HLA coverage of greater than 97% of 250 the world\u2019s population as shown in Table 14. We also calculated HLA coverage based on alleles specific to populations in China and found that coverage across those individuals could be expected to be within 3% percent of the world wide coverage estimate as shown in Table 15. This same population coverage could be achieved with 16 of the 53 unique peptides as shown in Table 13. 255 Seven of the 53 peptides with a predicted HLA match have been tested invitro for HLA binding affinity by various researchers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. These binding affinity assays were originally performed with the SARS virus during a previous outbreak.

            "As we have shown in this paper, a peptide targeted by EBOV controllers could form the basis of a preventative vaccine for EBOV. ELISPOT analysis of 270 PBMCs taken from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 controllers and progressors to assess the presence of a differential response to the 53 peptides could lead to a broadly applicable protective CTL vaccine against COVID-19 by incorporating peptides into the vaccine that are more commonly targeted for CD8+ attack by the controllers versus the progressors. The extent of the COVID-19 275 outbreak should allow many more controllers to be identified then the 30 individuals studied by Sakabe. Furthermore, Sakebe did not report progressor data perhaps because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples from those patients. If researchers act now during the COVID-19 outbreak, perhaps controller and progressor blood samples could be collected and prospectively analyzed, quickly creating a database of optimal candidate class I peptides for inclusion into a CTL vaccine with potentially broad HLA coverage for subsequent rapid manufacture and deployment. It would be interesting to see the extent to which the peptides favored by controllers appear on COVID-19 nucleocapsid, making COVID-19 a second example, across two different viruses, of controllers exhibiting CTL attack preferentially on the nucleocapsid protein.",
