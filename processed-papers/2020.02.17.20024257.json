        "abstract": "By proposing a varying coefficient Susceptible-Infected-Removal model (vSIR), we track the epidemic of COVID-19 in 30 provinces in China and 15 cities in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.",

The COVID-19 is caused by a new corona viruses that is genetically similar to the viruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Despite a relatively lower fatality rate comparing to SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 spreads faster and infects much more people than the SARS-03 outbreak.<br/><br/>The city of Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak, has been locked up to curtail population movement since January 23 in an effort to stop the spread of the epidemic, followed by more than 50 prefecture level cities (as on 8th of February) and countless number of towns and villages in China. A high percentage of the population are exercising self-isolation in their homes. The spring festival holiday period had been extended with all schools and universities closed and all students staying where they are indefinitely.

We report standard error in the parentheses following the estimate.<br/><br/>2.1. Main findings<br/><br/>\u2022 Despite the total number of confirmed cases and the death are increasing, the spread of COVID-19 has shown a great slowing down in China within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10 as shown by<br/><br/>88.0% and 86.8% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the provinces and the 15 cities in Hubei, respectively.<br/><br/>\u2022 The average R014 (based on 14-day infectious duration) on January 27th was 6.42 (1.57) and 7.67 (2.46), respectively, for the 27 provinces and the 7 Hubei cities with confirmed cases by January 23rd. One week later on February 3rd, the R014 was averaged at 2.39 (0.70) for the 30 provinces and 2.94 (0.56) for the 15 Hubei cities, representing 62.8%<br/><br/>and 61.7% reductions, respectively, over the 7 days. On February 10th, the average R014 dropped further to 0.77 (0.33) for the 30 provinces and<br/><br/>1.01 (0.43) for the 15 Hubei cities, which were either below or close to the critical threshold level 1.<br/><br/>\u2022 The profound slowing down in the reproductivity of COVID-19 can be attributed to a series of action and measures by the government and the public, which include cutting off Wuhan and other cities from<br/><br/>January 23, a rapid public awareness of the epidemic and the extensive self protection taken and high level of self isolation at home exercised over a much extended Spring Festival holiday period.<br/><br/>\u2022 There are increasing numbers of provinces and cities in Hubei whose<br/><br/>14-day R0 has been statistically below 1, as detailed in Table 1, which would foreshadow the coming of the turning point for containment of the epidemic, if the control measures implemented since January 23 can be continued."

We propose a varying coefficient Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (vSIR) model to estimate the dynamics of COVID-19 and predict its future course of spread.    3.1. Data<br/><br/>The daily records of infected, dead and recovered patients released by<br/><br/>National Health Commission of China (NHCC) are obtained from the NHCC website, with the first confirmed record for Wuhan on December 8th, 2019, followed by 30 provinces in mainland China and 15 cities in Hubei province where Wuhan is the capital city. We did not consider data from Tibet due to very small number of cases. Table A3 in SI provides the starting dates of the data records and analysis for each province and city. Due to severe under-reporting in the first 39 days of the epidemics in Wuhan and Hubei, we consider data from January 16th for Wuhan and Hubei. For other provinces and Hubei cities, the starting dates for data are those of first confirmed case, and the analysis date started four days afterward due to the estimation approach for estimating the infectious rate \u03b2(t). The latest start for analysis was January 29th for Qinghai province and three cities in Hubei province."
