The entire nation was in panic and worry about the spread of the virus; populations with pneumonia-like symptoms or Wuhan travel history were quarantined, flights and railway transportation were suspended around the nation, and new health centers specialized in infectious disease were constructed to accommodate the daily-increasing patients.",
            "Up to date, epidemiologists and health care professionals have used a number of mathematical models to predict the consequence and infection trajectories of the virus outbreak. Both kinetics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and statistics-based [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] models have predicted the basic reproduction number ranging from 2.0 to 4.0, which signify an alarming sign to designate this new virus as \u2018highly transmissible and communicable\u2019. In the past few days, the population of the infected people increased dramatically in Wuhan and other cities of China, due to the relative long latent period of this new virus. Latency period is defined as the time between infection with a virus and the appearance of symptoms. The accurate estimation of the latency period determines which kind of control measurement actions the health officials and governments should take. Latency period can also be used to predict the population of the people who is exposed to the virus but not yet converted to diseased state. The dormant virus",
            "is still active and transmissible, which is a hidden factor that brings about the most unpredictability and uncertainty of the current models.",
            "Latency period is the transition from \u2018exposed state\u2019 to \u2018diseased state\u2019, which is the rate-limiting step of the disease transmission process. In the fundamental elements of chemical reaction theory, chemical transition state is generally applicable to most of radicals or intermediate complex-associated reactions, including examples of photoactivation reaction or enzyme catalysis. Because of the synergy between the latent period of the \u2018exposed population\u2019 and the chemical transition of complex reactions, we here propose a viral transmission model that mimics the encounter complex state of virus to predict the exposed population, which we termed as SM* (Fig. 1), to describe the \u2018exposed population\u2019 at the latent period. The active virus source M* can be released from both the infected (I) and the exposed population (SM*), but not the deceased population D (assuming complete containment of this category). A simplified 7-step transmission mechanism has been exemplified in Fig. 1. Step 1 describes how fast a normal population could be converted to susceptible population who is at risk of infection. Step 2 describes the virus-releasing kinetics of infected people, with each infected people releasing n virus or virus-contaminated subjects (i.e. aerosols). Step 3 describes the infection kinetics of the susceptible people that is converted to an \u2018exposed population\u2019 at the latent phase. A reversible mechanism is proposed here since some of the exposed population didn\u2019t develop symptoms and could naturally return to the susceptible state. Step 4 describes the infection kinetics of the exposed population that is converted to infectious state. Step 5 and step 6 describe the recovery and death kinetics from the infectious population, respectively.",
            "Step 7 describes the decay kinetics of the active viral carrier to an inactive viral carrier. With fundamental mass action laws, we have formulated eight differential equations (Eqn1 to Eqn8) to describe the viral transmission kinetics based on the 7-step infectious mechanism. The mass balance of total populations (Ntot) and the total viral transmissible media (Mtot) were conseved by Eqn 9 and Eqn 10, respectively.",
            "With the recently reported cases of infection, death rate and exposed population, we used a set of parameters to simulate the model and predict the pandemic trajectory. In particular, our model is able to predict the trend of exposed population who is in the latent phase, and the total number of active viral source that remain infectious in the community (Fig. 2). We also introduced a migration rate (alpha = 0.1 people/week, which is unrealistically small in the current model) to describe potential flow of people moving into the system. With about",
            "0.83 weeks of latency period (\u0ada/\u0747\u0b38, \u202b\u0747 \u0741\u074e\u0744\u0741\u0753\u202c\u0b38 is 1.20/week in Fig. 2), we predict that the peak latent population is about 56,100 cases on Feb. 20th (0.5 week), and peak population of infected people is about 91,000 cases around March. 10th (3.3 weeks). Around March 15th (4 weeks), the number of active virial carrier start declining (Fig. 2) and 57.7% of the infected population will be cured or recovered. A projected deceased population is about 3,750 at a time window of 20 weeks (on June 5th).",
            "By considering the latency period factor, this model is also useful to predict the dynamic trajectory of the population at the latent phase (Fig. 3). The latent population with a 10-week latency period (88,500 cases) is about 75.2% higher than the latent population (about 50,500 cases) with a 0.67-week latency period; as a result (Fig. 3). With a 10-week latency period, the latent population (88,500 cases) is about 2.1-fold than the infected population (42,000 cases). However, the peak population of the infected people (91,000 cases) is 80.2% higher than the latent population (about 50,500 cases) with a 0.67-week latency period (Fig. 3). This result indicates that a rather long latency period decreases the total number of infected people, and the peak infection population is also postponed (Fig. 3). This prediction suggests that we must have an accurate estimation of the latency period before any coercive or preventative actions be taken. Based on the current report from different regions in China, it appears that some of the exposed people haven\u2019t shown any symptoms up to 2~3 weeks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], but this latent population will keep spreading the virus and transmitting the disease, a more severe transmission than the SARS pandemic in 2003 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. This uncertainty of the latency period complicates the infection measurements and may deteriorate the situation where people thought they have taken enough precautions to prevent the next outbreak of the virus.",
            "This simplified infectious disease transmission model takes into consideration of the latency period. The accurate prediction of the latency period will be critical for public health officials and authorities to make early preventions and take rigorous control measurements that stop the further spread of this deadly new virus."
