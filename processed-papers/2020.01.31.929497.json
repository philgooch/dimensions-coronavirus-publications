In particular, FAST-NA compares all k-mer sequences of a collection of target sequences to a collection of contrasting sequences in order to identify all k-mer sequences that are unique to the target population. These unique sequences are diagnostic of membership in the population, whereas shared sequences indicate structure that is conserved to some degree.",

In addition, we also identified 45 single amino-acid polymorphisms (Appendix Table 2).

Taking a cluster as any sequence of at least three unique regions with no more than 50 amino acids separating them, we find that QHO60603.1 has two clusters, one spanning from residues 916 \u2013 1294, the other from 6417 \u2013 6715, containing 47% of the unique material in the sequence.
