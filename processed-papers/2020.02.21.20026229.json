It severely threats people's health of thousands in Chin and even other countries. In order to prevent its wide spread, it is necessary to understand the development of the epidemic with precise mathematical language. \nMETHODS\n   The various data of novel coronavirus pneumonia were collected from the official websites of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. According to epidemic and administrative division, three groups were divided to analyze the data, Hubei Province (including Wuhan), nationwide without Hubei and Henan Province. With classic SIR models, the fitting epidemiological curves of incidence have made, and basic reproduction number (R0) was also calculated as well. Therefore the disease's infection intensity, peak time and the epidemiological end time can be deduced.",

Our study shows: (1) The epidemic development shows parabolic curves, and the incidence is expected to reach its peaks on February 10 in nationwide without Hubei and on February 18 in Hubei province successively. The epidemic will end after May in Hubei and after April in other area of China. (2) In early outbreak of epidemic, R0 was as high as 2.44-6.27, and with epidemic development, Rt will decrease and finally approach 0 after April in nationwide without Hubei and after May in Hubei province. (3) According to the data above, we suggest the closed management in city and community should be lifted after May in whole China. Without epidemic infection, citizens return to their normal work and life."

If R0> 1, the disease will spread away soon and radially; R0 <1 means the infection is in controllable situation. So, 1 is regarded as an important threshold to distinguish whether the disease will spread or not.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] During the epidemiological development of the disease, R0 is changeable. The dynamic reproduction number is called Rt (Effective Reproduction Number). In order to prevent and control epidemic, we must find a way to reduce Rt below 1 as much as possible. Chain growth rate was also calculated in various groups. Generally it refers to a growth rate relative to previous period. The formula is: Chain growth rate = (value in current period-value in last period) / (value of last period)x100%. Chain growth rate represents the growth speed of the data. The larger chain growth rate is, the greater growth rate is. The negative value represents a negative growth rate.",

After peak, the cases will gradually decrease, reaching the bottom in early April 2020. After that time, the epidemic will end. Figures 6 and 8 show that Rt values in nationwide without Hubei and Henan Province with S type. The values started at 2.44 and 2.9, and decreased to less than 1 after February 12th. They are expected to be close to 0 at the early April. Fig. 9 shows the infected patients among various groups. Discussion",
            "The epidemic development of COVID-19 shows a parabolic change. Since COVID-19 is highly transmissible and severely ill, scientists hope to understand its epidemiological development and forecast its future eagerly. Read et al ever tried to calculate the disappear time of the epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Since almost epidemics show their epidemiological development with classic parabolic distribution, therefore, SIR soft is designed according to the distribution. SIR is widely used to construct a mathematical model to understand the epidemic\u2019s transmission and outcome of the diseases. Our results showed that COVID-19 followed parabolic distribution as well, but the infection, peak time and disappear time are different among various areas. Among the three groups, the patients reach their peaks approximately on February 10 (nationwide except Hubei) and February 18 (Hubei province) successively. Then the epidemic will disappear in early April (Nationwide without Hubei) and early May (Hubei province). Our estimation has some difference from Read et al For instance, the peak value and cumulative cases seem to be less than theirs, and the ending time that we predict happens early. The differences may be caused by the data from different time and different source. Our data are relatively late and came from official publication. It should be acknowledged that our mathematical model is not perfect. Considering the sudden onset and some human intervention during the spread, our study only provides a rough description for the development of COVID-19 pneumonia.",
            "R0 is valuable parameter to evaluate the epidemic transmission capacity. WHO has predicted that R0 of this novel coronavirus transmission ranged from 1.4 to 2.5.13 Using exponential growth model, R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in the early outbreak of Wuhan was estimated 2.24 (95% CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95% CI: 2.89-4.39).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] With other methods, R0 was estimated to be 2-5,15-17 harmonizing with R0 of SARS-CoV (R0: 2-5),[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] which is slightly lower than Middle East respiratory syndrome (R0: 2.0-6.7).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] In our study, R0 ranges from 2.44 to 6.27, higher than previous studies above, suggesting the strong transmission for the disease. After February 18, R0 goes to less than 1, suggesting the transmission becomes weak.",
            "Hubei especially Wuhan is plagued by the epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 has 79.5% similar sequences.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] with SARS-CoV coronavirus and 51.8% similarity with MERS-Cov.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] but NCP\u2019s sudden outbreak and rapid spread is much higher than SARS or MERS-CoV. For COVID-19\u2019s outbreak, Hubei\u2019s situation is the most serious in China. The infected patients is listed at No 1 in the country, and by February 17 the cumulative cases are up to 59989 . The epidemic also develops very quickly, and in early onset its rising curve is very steep. The cumulative incidence rate is much higher than other areas of China. According to the fitting curve, the peak will arrive on February 18, several days later than other areas in China. In the meantime, the disappear time of epidemic will delay until early May, one month later than other areas. The epidemic period with more than half year in Hubei also lasts much longer than other areas in China. On the other hand, in nationwide without Hubei and Henan province, the number of patients and incidence rate have been kept at a relatively low level. In terms of contagion, at beginning, R0 in Hubei is 6.27, much higher than 2.44 in other areas of China. In this way, we can conclude that Hubei is serious stricken regions of the epidemic. There are several reasons to explain these differences between Hubei and other areas. (1) Hubei is origin of the plague, and the earliest cases were found in Wuhan. It is these patients who cause the widespread. (2) In early epidemic stage, the disease\u2019s jeopard and its infectious capacity have not been caused sufficient attention, therefore, the interventions are ineffective and inadequate. (3) Closed cities accelerate the disease transmission in Wuhan and Hubei, although the path of outward transmission is cut off. After January 23, Wuhan city and Hubei province started to close cities successively. In this way, about 60,000,000 people were limited in Hubei province. This makes Hubei become a closed infection system, which is bound to accelerate the spread of the disease. On the other hand, about 5 million people left Wuhan before the cities were closed, although the 5 million people became source of infection to other areas in China, the biggest source of infection is cut off. Fortunately, in Hubei, more interventions were accepted, for example calling on the citizens to stay at home.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] In this way, further transmission each other decreases, and the epidemic is slowed down. Due to reasons above, Hubei Province should be regarded as the plague hardest hit area and must acquire more medical supports. Luckily, more medical teams from all over the country have been sent to Wuhan city and Hubei province, and more and more effectively diagnostic kits and medicines can meet the Hubei\u2019s needs gradually.",
            "The epidemic forecast is important for NCP prevention. Our epidemiological model has guiding significance for COVID-19 prevention. At present, closed management of towns and communities is carried out in many areas throughout the country. Many traffic are blocked, and works, schools and markets are suspended,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] which has brought extremely inconvenience for citizens. Citizens look forward to a rapid improvement in this situation. Probably, our study is helpful to solve the problems above. The epidemiological model shows: from February 10 to 18, the confirmed patients will reach their peaks in various areas successively, and after that dates, the epidemic will be improved. Rt will also approach 0 after April in nationwide without Hubei and after May in Hubei province. It means that the epidemic will end without infection, suggesting the closed management can be lifted after May in Hubei and April in other areas of China, then citizens can return to normal work and life.",
            "In summary, with classic SIR models, the fitting epidemiological curves have made to simulate the occurrence, development and end of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China, and R0 is calculated as well. Our study shows: (1) The epidemic development shows parabolic curves, and the incidence is expected to reach its peaks on February 10 in nationwide without Hubei and on February 18 in Hubei province successively. The epidemic will end after May in Hubei and after April in other area of China. (2) In early outbreak of epidemic, R0 was as high as 2.44-6.27, and with epidemic development, Rt will decrease and finally approach 0 after April in nationwide without Hubei and after May in Hubei province. (3) According to the data above, we suggest the closed management in city and community should be lifted after May in whole China. Without epidemic infection, citizens return to their normal work and life.",
