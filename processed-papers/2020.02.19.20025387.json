        "abstract": "Background: Since its first cases occurrence in Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to other provinces and neighboring countries. A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread.\nMethods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). \nFindings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city.\nInterpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.",

Although R0 for the COVID-19 was declined on February 16 in<br/><br/>China, it was still higher in China (1.66; 95% CI 1.86\u20131.46), compared to the range of the R0 for<br/><br/>SARS epidemic[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], and for MERS[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. On the other hand, such a high number for R0 was consistent with the opinion that the virus had gone through at least three-to-four generations of transmission and suggested that there might be a possibility of aerosol transmission as SARS did[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], though whether there was aerosol transmission needs further investigation.<br/><br/>Nowcasting and forecasting are of crucial importance for public health planning and control, both domestically and internationally. Our models evaluated the epidemic situation in Wuhan and in other parts of China separately, with the consideration of various intervention measures. The results of our modeling suggest that Wuhan have reached a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February, with the maximum number of confirmed cases at 1,718 per day, while the peak of the number of confirmed individuals in the whole country has already occurred around February 3 and will reach single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in in the whole country except Wuhan.

This study found self-quarantine at home should be strictly observed in the future, and that the quarantine level to be maintained at a relatively high level to prevent the possibility of a second outbreak of the epidemic. When the accuracy and sensitivity has been improved substantially, e.g., by using CT scan instead of depending only on testing kits, the continued success may still rely on the community screening in order not to miss any and effectively cut the transmission chain from those with mild symptoms. Furthermore, professional medical care personnel should supervise centralized quarantine at certain quarantine sites, to better monitor and manage infected peoples and prevent further expansion of infection and improve the health of the patients. Given the high rate of infectivity of this new coronavirus, and there is still a possibility of the virus being spread globally, the countries other China also need to mobilize enough medical supplies to deal with this massive outbreak based on local risk assessments.<br/><br/>Author contributions"

To predict the impact of various quarantine rates, we set isolate rate=10% as the baseline number of cases; when setting isolate rate=20%, it reduced to 1,159,720 inpatients cases on the day of peak numbers, a decrease of 11.18%; isolate rate=30% would reduce the number of inpatients cases to 933,070 (Figure 3).",
            "In the Wuhan Model, we set a function related to the parameter m and time t as follows: before January",
            "23, 2020, m infected people contacted the Seafood Wholesale Market, while the zoonotic infective cases no longer occurred thereafter due to the closure of that Market. The Model simulated various scenarios to assess the impact on the epidemic situation of an increase in the force of infection by 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 times. By predicting the impact of the number of zoonotic infective cases, we set 43 as the number of baseline cases. Doubling the number m (to 86) increased the number of cases by 1408 on the peak day, and enhanced the confirmed cases by approximately 9.10% on that day, while augmenting m to triple the baseline increased the confirmed cases by approximately 22.58% (Suppl. Figure 5).",
            "Figure 4 shows the fitting of the nationwide mathematical modeling. Our Model rationally fitted the trend of the daily numbers of newly confirmed cases in other parts of China, and predicted that the peak number of confirmed cases would occur around February 3, while the highest number of confirmed cases would reach 1,756 per day.

The COVID-19 cases would gradually disappear by the end of April. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on",

            "When the population inflow is 6 million, the number of new cases per day reaches a peak of 1,838, while inflow become 3 million, the number would be 1,539. An increase of 16.2% over the peak would occur when the population inflow was 6 million. We also found that the change in the inflow population was relatively insensitive to the population flow.",
            "By predicting the impact of various quarantine rates on the number of cases each day, we observed that the peak decreased gradually, and the number of new and cumulative confirmed cases per day had a clear downward trend with the gradual increase of the quarantine rate; when the inflow population remained constant, every 5% increase in quarantine rate reduced the numbers of the cumulative confirmed cases, on average, by 313 cases on the peak day. Furthermore, setting the quarantine rate at",
            "45% would reduce the number by 939 cases on the peak day compared to when the quarantine rate was set at 30% (Figure 6). When the detection rate gradually increased, the peak gradually moved forward, and the number of newly confirmed patients showed a significant downward trend. Also, that every 0.2 increase in the detection rate leads to an advance of 1-2 days at the peak (Suppl. Figure 7).",
            "Figure 7 shows that the risk index of COVID-19 risk spread by the outflow population of Wuhan to different cities. The top 5 cities ranked by the risk index are Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing and Xianyang. And The number of incubators from Wuhan to these cities on the 16th to the rd, 2020 were 474, 513, 249, and 40, 145 cases, respectively. The risk index of 15 cities was consistent with the actual cumulative number of confirmed cases (r=0.88, p= 3.8*10^-8, and the actual cumulative number of confirmed cases were calculated until February 10, 2020).",

        ],
        "DISCUSSION": [
            "Based on the COVID-19 cases data from 16 January 2020 to 16 February 2020, the data showed that",
            "R0 declined with time as well as with implementation of different policies, from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (except Wuhan), which was consistent with other studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] but we first estimate the trends. Although R0 for the COVID-19 was declined on February 16 in",
            "China, it was still higher in China (1.66; 95% CI 1.86\u20131.46), compared to the range of the R0 for",

On the other hand, such a high number for R0 was consistent with the opinion that the virus had gone through at least three-to-four generations of transmission and suggested that there might be a possibility of aerosol transmission as SARS did[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], though whether there was aerosol transmission needs further investigation.",
            "Nowcasting and forecasting are of crucial importance for public health planning and control, both domestically and internationally. Our models evaluated the epidemic situation in Wuhan and in other parts of China separately, with the consideration of various intervention measures. The results of our modeling suggest that Wuhan have reached a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February, with the maximum number of confirmed cases at 1,718 per day, while the peak of the number of confirmed individuals in the whole country has already occurred around February 3 and will reach single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in in the whole country except Wuhan. In addition, our study predicts that the number of inpatients in Wuhan reached a peak of 13,030 on 14 February, and begin to decline, which can provide certain basis for hospital bed arrangement.",
            "Model fitting for the newly confirmed cases per day gave a number that was lower than the actual number, and the peak number of newly confirmed infected cases per day in the model fitting of the entire country except Wuhan was also lower than the actual number \u2013 these discrepancies may be due to underreporting, and delayed diagnosis during the early stages of the epidemic. The underreporting and insufficient diagnosis might be due to less nucleic acid test kits, false negative result of the testing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], and asymptomatic patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Due to the recent change of more availability of test kits and greater efforts of various government departments, the detection capacity has continuously improved, leading to a sharp rise in patients\u2019 numbers compared to the models\u2019 estimates.",
            "Current interventions, including extended vacations and self-quarantine at home, aim to isolate high-risk populations. We have analyzed the different quarantine rates, to determine how this variation changes the epidemic trend. Assuming that the major cities in the country have not taken the first level response, the isolation rate is not as high as it is currently, we reduced the quarantine rate and simulate the situation that if the country has not taken the first level response in Wuhan. When the quarantine rate was 10%, the peak value of newly confirmed cases would be 1,305,713 in Wuhan; when the quarantine rates became 20%, 30% and 40%, the peak value of newly confirmed cases would reach",
            "1,159,720, 933,070 and 588,814 in Wuhan respectively. The scenario suggested that Wuhan \u2019s mandatory isolation and first-level response had played a great role in the stop of epidemic spreading.",
            "Many cities in the country had started the first level response. We reduce the isolation rate in the",
            "National model to the scenario that the first level response was not launched. When the quarantine rates are 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, the peak value of newly confirmed cases will reach 3,532, 3,151, 2,753, and",
            "2,593 in the entire country. And if the quarantine rate is less than 30%, the new confirmed cases will grow explosively. Comparing to the current situation with a maximal quarantine rate of 80% in the",
            "National Model, it adds up 837 confirmed cases each day at least, which shows the quarantine intervention and first level response measures taken by some cities in China are indispensable policies and show positive effect on the control of the COVID-19. The Return-to-Work tide is approaching, especially in major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, upgraded measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial for the blockage of the COVID-19. We assumed that the isolation rate in Wuhan will reach 85% and 80% in the whole country except Wuhan. However, if we further improve the isolation rate, the epidemic will end ahead of time.",
            "A proportion of the first generation of infected people had visited the Seafood Market in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "Due to the existence of asymptomatic infections and the possibility of missed diagnoses, rather than analyzing just the number of people who have been to the Seafood Market, we have instead analyzed the number of people who have contact history with the Seafood Market; when this alternative situation is taken into consideration, the greater the number of people who visited the Seafood Market in the early stage the bigger is the number of people infected, with a higher peak value. However, this relationship is not sensitive. While people at the Market were found and isolated and were no longer contagious, the scale of transmission of this first generation of virus might be larger than that of other infected individuals.",
            "This study primarily focused on the situation that can be judged from the appearance of some infection symptoms, such as fever, dry cough, etc[17]. According to the latest research results of Dr. Zhong",
            "Nanshan, they proved the presence of another type of infected people \u2013 those who are asymptomatic infections at COVID-19 diagnosis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. According to the results of the Wuhan Model and National model(excluded Wuhan), there are indeed asymptomatic cases with peak values 1,071 in Wuhan (766 in the other parts of China) and Isse cases with peak values 419 cases in Wuhan (438 in the other parts of China), asymptomatic cases are hidden virus carrier, finding them is extremely difficult but this population will increase in number rapidly, which is particularly challenging in terms of prevention and control. The only effective intervention for asymptomatically infected people is to prevent close personal contacts. Concurrently, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases (14,008 on February 10 in the other parts of China), which can provide some basis for the arrangement of hospital beds. The model further shows that the",
            "COVID-19 cases will gradually disappear by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would decrease to less than 10 on March 27 in Wuhan and",
            "March 19 in the other parts of China.",
            "During the current epidemic outbreak, the public should be reminded not only to practice at-home quarantine, but also to pay attention to personal protection, e.g. wearing masks, and reducing communicating with other people in person, especially after the stage of high level response (travel restricts, the postponement of school semesters, etc.) . As the potential long incubation period of the",
            "COVID-19, the effects of public health measures, such as to place someone and his/her close contacts under medical quarantine at both the hospital and community, would also depend on the swift and accurate diagnosis \u2013 any delay will make the public to pay a high cost[18].",
            "Our study has several limitations. First, there is no enough data to provide accurate information about quarantine rates and detection rates at each stage of the epidemic, as the denominator could also be underestimated due to limited medical source for treatment, false positive testing kits. However, we have adjusted for the initial values of the parameters in the models based on the available survey data.",
            "Second, based on the changes in prevention and control modes and societal efforts at each stage, we have estimated the functions of the quarantine and detection rates in relation to time, in order to simulate the actual conditions as closely as possible. In addition, we were unable to obtain some relevant data that may be very important to the study, such as the exposure and possible infection rates of healthcare workers nationwide[19]. Instead, we use the estimation for exposure and infection rate of that population from a survey (unpublished data) based on a big specialized hospital in Wuhan."

        "CONCLUSIONS": [
            "China\u2019s prevention and control measures have made significant inroads into controlling the epidemic of",
            "COVID-19, but the complete control has not yet to be achieved. This study found self-quarantine at home should be strictly observed in the future, and that the quarantine level to be maintained at a relatively high level to prevent the possibility of a second outbreak of the epidemic. When the accuracy and sensitivity has been improved substantially, e.g., by using CT scan instead of depending only on testing kits, the continued success may still rely on the community screening in order not to miss any and effectively cut the transmission chain from those with mild symptoms. Furthermore, professional medical care personnel should supervise centralized quarantine at certain quarantine sites, to better monitor and manage infected peoples and prevent further expansion of infection and improve the health of the patients. Given the high rate of infectivity of this new coronavirus, and there is still a possibility of the virus being spread globally, the countries other China also need to mobilize enough medical supplies to deal with this massive outbreak based on local risk assessments.",
