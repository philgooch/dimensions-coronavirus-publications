Users permit Tencent to collect their real-time location information when they install applications, such as WeChat (\u22481.13 billion active users in 2019) and QQ (\u2248808 million active users in 2019), and Tencent Map. By using the geolocation of users over time, Tencent reconstructed anonymized origin\u2013destination mobility matrices by mode of transportation (air, road, and train) between 370 cities in China, including 368 cities in mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. The data are anonymized and include 28 million trips to and 32 million trips from Wuhan, during December 3, 2016\u2013January 24, 2017. We estimated daily travel volume during the 7 weeks preceding the Wuhan quarantine, December 1, 2019\u2013January 22, 2020, by aligning the dates of the Lunar New Year, resulting in a 3-day shift. To infer the number of new infections in Wuhan per day during December 1, 2019\u2013January 22, 2020, we used the mean daily number of passengers traveling to the top 27 foreign destinations from Wuhan during 2018\u20132019, which were provided in other recent studies (\u200b1\u2013\u200b3)."

Given that an estimated 98% of all trips between Wuhan and other Chinese cities during this period were taken by train or car, our analysis of air, rail, and road travel data yields more granular risk estimates than possible with air passenger data alone (7).",
            "By fitting our epidemiologic model to data on the first 19 cases reported outside of China, we estimate an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days (95% CrI 6.26 - 9.66 days) and a cumulative total of 12,400 (95% CrI 3,112\u201358,465) infections in Wuhan by January 22, 2020 (Appendix). Both estimates are consistent with a recent epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 cases confirmed in Wuhan (8). By assuming these rates of early epidemic growth, we estimate that 130"

            "This represents the ratio between the 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan during this period (\u200b22\u200b) and the estimate that 4,747 (95% CrI 1,480\u201319,151) cumulative infections occurred by January 12, 2020 (i.e., \u226510 days before the quarantine to account for the typical lag between infection and case detection).",
