The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken.",

The total population of Malaysia is denoted as N and it is assumed that the population is homogeneous. It is assumed that initially the total population is susceptible, hence S0 = N.",
            "(b) Based on the growing number of cases worldwide within a short period, the disease is assumed to spread sufficiently fast that the birth and the natural death rates can be considered as negligible in the model.",
            "(c) It is assumed that the 2019-nCoV is able to transmit between human to human.",
            "The compartmental model is thus depicted in Figure 1. Since the patient zero may be infectious and was mobile and freely interacting then susceptible human becomes exposed with the disease at a transmission rate f. Once exposed, the incubation period starts and then after the period ends then those exposed moves to the Infected compartment at a rate c and when they recovered from the disease then they will move to the Recovered compartment at a rate k. However, there are some infected cases who may die due to the disease with the given rate of d.",
