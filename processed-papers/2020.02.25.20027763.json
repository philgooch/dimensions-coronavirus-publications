On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008). Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies. Funding None.",

            "With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among febrile patients with acute respiratory infections. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing. Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an"

            "The first cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown origin emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in early December, 2019 1,2. A novel coronavirus had been isolated from these patients, and subsequently named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 12, 2020 3, and later as SARS-CoV-2. The initially confirmed cases were localized in Wuhan and mostly associated with Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in the city 2, but soon the disease spread rapidly to other areas of the country. On January 19, 2020, two cases in Beijing and one case in Guangdong Province were reported 4, and subsequently more cases were reported elsewhere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].<br/><br/>Since the outbreak in Wuhan, as a quick response, Fever Clinics were requested to reinforce case finding of pneumonia of unknown etiologies. Fever Clinics, mostly affiliated to the Division of Infectious Diseases in general hospitals, had been established after SARS outbreak in 2003, and since then served as the first line to monitor and manage acute febrile respiratory infections, mostly seasonal influenza in recent years.

            "With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among febrile patients with acute respiratory infections. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing. Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an",

On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008). Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies. Funding None."

            "The first cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown origin emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in early December, 2019 1,2. A novel coronavirus had been isolated from these patients, and subsequently named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 12, 2020 3, and later as SARS-CoV-2. The initially confirmed cases were localized in Wuhan and mostly associated with Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in the city 2, but soon the disease spread rapidly to other areas of the country. On January 19, 2020, two cases in Beijing and one case in Guangdong Province were reported 4, and subsequently more cases were reported elsewhere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",

Men and women were equally affected. Nineteen patients (90.5%) had a clear epidemiological history of COVID-19. Seven patients, from 5 family clusters, had close contact with their family members.

We found that epidemiological history was extremely important for identification of suspected cases of COVID-19 and for differential diagnosis. Over 90% of the COVID-19 patients had clearly identified epidemiological evidence, while in non-COVID-19 patients, epidemiological links could only be found in 32.8%. In our series, most cases were imported from the city of Wuhan or Hubei Province, including traveling to or living in Wuhan or other cities in Hubei, and a few had a history of close contact with individuals coming from the above areas. In the later phase of our study, contact with family members with confirmed COVID-19 was an epidemiological feature and five family clusters were found. A report from Chinese CDC showed that the incidence of COVID-19 outside Hubei Province peaked in Jan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>-27] and most cases (68.6%) had ever exposed to Wuhan or Hubei within 14 days 11. Weight of exposure history related to Wuhan and Hubei in confirmed cases was decreasing after February 11.

Increased total WBC and neutrophil counts were more common in patients with other causes of pneumonia. In contrast, although decrease of lymphocytes was also common in our study, the difference between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases was not significant, probably due to the fact that pneumonias enrolled for this analysis were mostly viral(for example, influenza) or atypical, as classical bacterial pneumonia had been excluded by first screening/triage. Additionally, the percentage of our patients with decreased lymphocytes was not as high as that reported in some previous studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], perhaps due to differences in disease severity. Blood lymphopenia was observed in up to 85% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 16. Compared with mild and moderate cases, severe cases were more likely to have lymphopenia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. A recent paper by Xu and colleagues showed a lymphocyte decrease in 38% of the cases within symptom onset \u226410 days 18, which was consistent with our data. Therefore, we speculate that persisting decrease of lymphocytes may be an indicator of severe disease, rather than a criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Firstly, multi-lobe involvement was more common in COVID-19 as compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. The lesions, including GGO, mixed GGO and consolidation, or patchy consolidation, were mainly distributed in peripheral and sub-pleural areas in mild to moderate cases, while in severe cases diffuse ground glass lesions were present. In the study by Pan and colleagues, 11.1% and 44.4% of the 63 patients showed four and five lobe involvement, with patchy/punctate GGO and patchy consolidation being the dominant patterns on CT scan 19.
