We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19.\nMethods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined.\nFindings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS.\nInterpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians. \nFunding: Health and Family Planning Commission of Wuhan Municipality.",

            "The emergent outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a threat to the public health worldwide 1,2. As of February 24, 2020, 77,262 cases were confirmed, and 2,595 death cases were recorded in China. The number of confirmed cases in other countries are ascending as well 3-5. COVID-19 may impose a great socioeconomic, public health, and clinical burden, especially in the low-income and middle-income countries.",
            "Growing studies identified the clinical features of COVID-19 6-8. Similar to SARS in",
            "2003, this infectious disease results in the high possibility of the admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the mortality 6. Notably, due to the cytokine cascade within a short period, the critically ill patients with COVID-19 were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and receive oxygen treatment 6.",
            "ARDS was the most common complication in COVID-19 patients, with a high mortality rate 6,7. The latest publication in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Yang et al 9 reported that 67% of critically ill patients develop ARDS. However, little is known regarding the clinical characteristics, treatment, and progression of COVID-19 patients according to the severity of ARDS.",
            "In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, and determined the differences in the clinical characteristics between COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS.",
            "Additionally, to reveal the evolvement of ARDS in COVID-19, we also investigated the clinical features and therapies of COVID-19 patients at each severity level of",

        "Results": [
            "A total of 109 patients with COVID-19 were included in the current study. The baseline clinical parameters of overall COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS were summarized in Table 1. Mean age of all subjects was years (IQR, 43-66 years; range, 22-94 years), and 54.1% of all patients were male.",
            "The most common symptom at the illness onset was fever (82.6%), followed by dry cough (61.5%) and fatigue (56.9%). Seventy-six patients (69.7%) had underlying comorbidities, including hypertension (33.9%), diabetes (11.0%), and chronic kidney disease (9.2%). The first virus RNA detection rate was 24.8% in the fever clinics, and all patients were reconfirmed by repeated virus RNA testing after admission. Among patients, 53 (48.6%) of them developed ARDS, 100 (91.7%) of them had bilateral involvement of the chest radiographs, and 28 (25.7%) patients received high-flow nasal oxygen ventilation, while 31 (28.4%) died.",
            "Compared with non-ARDS patients with COVID-19, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have coexistent diabetes (20.8%",
            "vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1%",
            "vs. 3.6%). The bilateral involvement in the chest radiographs was identified in all",
            "ARDS patients, but in 83.9% non-ARDS patients. The likelihood to receive high-flow nasal ventilation for ARDS patients (49.1%) was significantly higher than that for non-ARDS patients (3.6%). The mortality rate in ARDS patients (49.1%) was also significantly higher than that in non-ARDS patients (8.9%).",
            "Disease Severity Scores and Laboratory Findings in COVID-19 Patients With and Without ARDS",
            "The disease severity evaluation and laboratory examination of non-ARDS and ARDS patients with COVID-19 on admission were shown in Table 2. Compared with non-",

The levels of lactate, blood urea nitrogen, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase ascended with the severity of ARDS (all P values <0.05), whereas the lymphocyte count levels decreased (P value = 0.045). Patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS were the most likely to receive glucocorticoid therapy (P value = 0.02) and high-flow nasal oxygen ventilation (P value <0.001). Compared to patients with mild ARDS, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates (P value <0.001). Subsequent survival analysis was shown in Figure 2.

        "Discussion": [
            "In the present study of ARDS progression in COVID-19, we firstly identified the differences in the clinical manifestations between COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS. Second, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients varied with the severity of ARDS. High mortality rates were observed in patients with moderateto-severe ARDS. Third, we did not observe any apparent effect of the current therapeutic interventions on the in-hospital survival of COVID-19 patients with",
            "ARDS. Our findings might highlight the clinical significance in the enhanced attention towards COVID-19 patients at high risks of ARDS.",
            "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the clinical features and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients according to the severity of ARDS.",
            "We revealed that elder patients, or complicated by diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, were more likely to develop ARDS. This finding might further explain the significant association of age and comorbidity conditions with the poor clinical outcomes in a previous COVID-19 study 7. In addition, the elevated levels of neutrophil count, CRP, procalcitonin and D-dimer, but the decreased lymphocyte count levels, were detected in patients with ARDS, rather than those without ARDS. Similarly, the levels of lactate and D-dimer increased with the progression of ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2, while severer lymphopenia occurred over time. Our investigations into these laboratory indicators were comparable with other",
            "COVID-19 studies 6,7,13, suggesting that cytokine cascade, excessive inflammatory reaction, and coagulation dysfunction might evolve in the course of ARDS resulted from SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Our understanding of this ARDS progression could be furthered by a recent autopsy report on a 50-year-old COVID-19 patient with ARDS 14, which was highlighted by the inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in both lungs and the immune hyperactivation in the patient. Interestingly, no obvious heart injury occurred in this patient, while the liver injury might be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or medication use 14. These pathological results were concordant with our clinical observation of a dysregulated inflammatory and immune state in COVID-19 patients with ARDS, which might in turn help to guide our medical therapy.",
            "The medical management of ARDS has advanced remarkably during the past decades from 11% to 87% 16. In our study, most patients with COVID-19 received antibiotics and antivirus treatment, while over half of them were given by glucocorticoid and intravenous immunoglobulin therapies. Moderate-to-severe ARDS patients were more likely to use high-flow nasal oxygen ventilation. Unfortunately, the mortality rate was extremely high in severe ARDS patients with COVID-19, and the survival of COVID-",
            "patients with ARDS was not improved by the antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment. Some potential reasons might interpret the high mortality we observed: First, due to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within a short period, the",
            ". However, the general mortality rates of ARDS caused by all etiologies fluctuated designated hospitals were overloaded in short term, with inadequate medical facilities and insufficient medical staff. Notably, intensive care resources are in short supply and may fail to meet demand under the increasing number critically ill patients.",
            "Second, the Central Hospital of Wuhan is close to Huanan Seafood Market, and the inpatients were the first or the second generation infected patients. In addition, the inadequate preparation and insufficient understanding of the disease might contribute to increased mortality in the front-line epidemic area during the early outbreak period.",
            "The epidemic spread knows no borders. We are deeply concerned about the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. As the low-income and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to the lack of medical resources, the mortality rate of infectious diseases may be even higher. Therefore, from a policy perspective, the government should provide capital, technology, and manpower to curb the epidemic. Meanwhile, in the front-line epidemic area, limited medical resources should be allocated reasonably and effectively. Based on our observation, some patients progress quickly to severe pneumonia or ARDS without warning sign. Adequate critical care resources and the involvement of intensive care physicians are essential in the early stages of the SARS-",
            "CoV-2 outbreak.",
            "The present study is subjected to several limitations. Due to the retrospective nature of the present study, a systematic selection bias could be introduced. We could not completely address the residual confounding factors as well. Although our laboratory observations showed the significant changes with the time and the severity of ARDS, the clinical predictive value remained to be determined. In addition, our results on the effect of the current treatments should be considered with caution, and high-quality clinical interventional studies are needed. Meanwhile, the benefits of the invasive ventilation therapy on the disease prognosis should be further investigated. In the future, a multi-center and follow-up study with a larger cohort is eagerly warranted."

The current medical treatments might not have a significant effect on the in-hospital survival of COVID-19 patients with ARDS.
