        "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 \u00c5 in the presence of B0AT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 \u00c5, allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor. Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. Pairwise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine the different affinities between ACE2 and the RBDs from these two related viruses.",

In this study, we carefully analyzed the interface in both RBD-ACE2 complexes. Whereas some of the variations may strengthen the interactions between nCoV-RBD and ACE2, others may reduce the affinity compared to that between SARS-RBD and ACE2. For instance, the change from Val404 to Lys317 may result in tighter association because of the salt bridge formation between Lys317 and Asp30 of ACE2 (Figs. 3C, 4C). Change of Leu472 to Phe486 may also make stronger van der Waals contact with Met82 (Fig. 4D). However, replacement of Arg426 to Asn439 appears to weaken the interaction by losing one important salt bridge with Asp329 on ACE2 (Fig. 4B)."

            "Overall structure of the RBD-ACE2-B0AT1 complex To reveal the recognition details between ACE2 and the 2019-nCoV, we purchased 0.2 mg recombinantly expressed and purified RBD-mFc of the 2019-nCoV (for simplicity, we will refer it as RBD for short if not specified) from Sino Biological Inc., mixed it with our purified ACE2-B0AT1 complex at a stoichiometric ratio of ~ 1.1 to 1, and proceeded with cryo-grid preparation and imaging. Following the same protocol for data processing as for the ACE2-B0AT1 complex, a 3D EM reconstruction of the ternary complex was obtained. The structural findings about the dimeric full-length ACE2 and its complex interaction with B0AT1, which were reported in detail in our bioRxiv posting [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] , will not be repeated here. In this manuscript, we will focus on the interface between ACE2 and RBD.",
            "In contrast to the ACE2-B0AT1 complex, which has two conformations, \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d, only the closed state of ACE2 was observed in the dataset for the RBD-ACE2B0AT1 ternary complex. Out of 527,017 selected particles, the overall resolution of the ternary complex was achieved at 2.9 \u00c5. However, the resolution for the ACE2-B0AT1 complex is substantially higher than that for the RBDs, which are at the peripheral region of the complex (Fig. 1A). To improve the local resolutions, focused refinement was applied. Finally, the resolution of the RBDs reached 3.5 \u00c5, supporting reliable modelling and interface analysis (Figs. 1, 2; Supplementary Figures S1,S2, Table S1).",
            "Interface between RBD and ACE2 As expected, each PD accommodates one RBD (Fig. 1B). The overall interface is similar to that between the SARS-CoV and ACE2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], mediated mainly through polar interactions (Fig. 3A). An extended loop region of RBD spans above the arch-shaped \u03b11 helix of ACE2 like a bridge. The \u03b12 helix and a loop that connects the \u03b23 and \u03b24 antiparallel strands, referred to as Loop 3-4, of the PD also make limited contributions to the coordination of RBD.",
            "The contact can be divided to three clusters. The two ends of the \u201cbridge\u201d attach to the amino (N) and carboxyl (C) termini of the \u03b11 helix as well as small areas on the \u03b12 helix and Loop 3-4. The middle segment of \u03b11 reinforces the interaction by engaging two polar residues (Fig. 3A). For illustration simplicity, we will refer to the N and C termini of the \u03b11 helix as right and left. On the left, Gln498, Thr500, and Asn501 of the RBD form a network of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) with Tyr41, Gln42, Lys353, and Arg357 from ACE2 (Fig. 3B). In the middle of the \u201cbridge\u201d, Lys417 and Tyr453 of the RBD interact with Asp30 and His34 of ACE2, respectively (Fig. 3C). On the right, Gln474 of RBD is H-bonded to Gln24 of ACE2, while Phe486 of RBD interacts with Met82 of ACE2 through van der Waals forces (Fig. 3D)."

            "The 2019-nCoV has killed more people in the past two months than SARS-CoV because of its high infectivity, whose underlying mechanism remains unclear. A furin cleavage site unique to the S protein of the 2019-nCoV may contribute to its greater infectivity than SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The recently reported higher affinity between the nCoV-RBD and ACE2 may represent an additional factor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].",
            "Structures of ACE2 in complex with nCoV-RBD and SARS-RBD establish the molecular basis to dissect their different affinities. In this study, we carefully analyzed the interface in both RBD-ACE2 complexes. Whereas some of the variations may strengthen the interactions between nCoV-RBD and ACE2, others may reduce the affinity compared to that between SARS-RBD and ACE2. For instance, the change from Val404 to Lys317 may result in tighter association because of the salt bridge formation between Lys317 and Asp30 of ACE2 (Figs. 3C, 4C). Change of Leu472 to Phe486 may also make stronger van der Waals contact with Met82 (Fig. 4D). However, replacement of Arg426 to Asn439 appears to weaken the interaction by losing one important salt bridge with Asp329 on ACE2 (Fig. 4B).",
            "Our structure provides the molecular basis for computational and mutational analysis for the understanding of the affinity difference. It should be noted that additional approaches, such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscal thermophoresis (MST), should be applied to validate SPR-measured affinities.",
            "Structural elucidation nCoV-RBD to ACE2 also set up the framework for the development of novel viral detection methods and potential therapeutics against the 2019-nCoV. Structure-based rational design of binders with enhanced affinities to either ACE2 or the S protein of the coronaviruses may facilitate development of decoy ligands or neutralizing antibodies that block viral infection."
