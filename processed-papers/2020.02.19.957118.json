        "abstract": "Using incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a murine genetic reference population, we previously identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with low SARS-CoV titer. In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4\u2019s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.ImportanceGiven the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.",

            "Selection of Muc4 as a SARS-CoV disease associated gene<br/><br/>In earlier studies, incipient CC lines were used to identify four QTLs associated with<br/><br/>SARS-CoV phenotypes in female mice, one of which was mapped on the basis viral titer in the lung at four DPI (Gralinski et al, 2015). A subsequent study utilizing both male and female F2<br/><br/>mice derived from a highly susceptible and highly resistant CC mouse line identified five more<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-associated QTLs, three of which were mapped at least partially on the basis of viral titer (Gralinski et al, 2017).<br/><br/>36,719,997, the pre-CC QTL accounted for 22% of the variation in viral titer, which ranged from over 108 PFU/lobe to below the limit of detection (102 PFU/lobe). The F2 QTLs, by comparison, were located on chromosomes 18, 7, and 12 and explained 12.9%, 12.3%, and 5.4%, respectively, of the observed variation in titers from high 10 2 to low 107 PFU/lobe. Thus, while<br/><br/>SARS-CoV titer in the lung is clearly influenced by multiple host genetic factors, the preCC QTL on chromosome 16 was chosen for candidate gene selection and validation. Analysis of allele effects revealed that the founder PWK/PhJ was the main driver of low SARS-CoV titer in the lung (Fig. 1A), and PWK/PhJ also had lower titers than any other founder strain at four DPI (Gralinski et al, 2015). We therefore used private SNPs or In/Dels found in PWK/PhJ to reduce the potential targets in the QTL to seven ncRNAs and 74 genes for downstream analysis."

These studies can also provide therapeutic, prophylactic and molecular insights into emerging pathogens, which are difficult to study during the context of an outbreak. Here, prior phenotypic QTL analysis, bioinformatics, and RNA expression analysis were leveraged to identify Muc4 as a high priority candidate gene driving differences in SARS-CoV titer. Utilizing a Muc4 knockout mouse, a role was confirmed for the gene in augmented SARS-CoV pathogenesis. While virus titers trended higher in Muc4-/-<br/><br/>mice at day 2 and 4, there was no statistically significant change as compared to WT control mice. However, in absolute terms the Muc4-/- mice did have a modest 62% higher titer on day two and a 51% higher titer on day four as compared to WT, and it is possible that this difference is biologically significant despite the lack of statistical significance as determined by p-value (Lytsy et al, 2018; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVyas_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rVyas_et+al_2015_a\">Vyas et al, 2015</a>).

            "Using incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a murine genetic reference population, we previously identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with low SARS-CoV titer. In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung.",
            "To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female",
            "Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4\u2019s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.",
            "Given the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.",
