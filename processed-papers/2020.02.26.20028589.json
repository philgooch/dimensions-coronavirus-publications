        "abstract": "Importance:\nHeart injury can be easily induced by viral infection such as adenovirus and enterovirus. However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated.\nObjective:\nTo explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nA single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020.\nExposures: \nHigh levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; \u03b1-HBDH).\nMain Outcomes and Measures:\nMortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days).\nResults:\nOf 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (\u2265 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and \u03b1-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and \u03b1-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and \u03b1-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022).\nConclusions and Relevance:\nHeart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.",

            "Viral infection is a common cause of heart injury such as myocarditis. It is well known that adenovirus, enterovirus and herpesvirus are the most common infectious etiologies for heart injury [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Since coronavirus-related carditis was first reported in 1980 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], increasing studies noted that coronavirus is an uncommon but unneglectable pathogen for heart injury. For instance, we found the coronavirus of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 in China had no obvious connections with heart injury. However, it was reported that the coronavirus of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 in Saudi Arabia could cause acute myocarditis and heart failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious viral pneumonia breaking out in Wuhan, China since Dec, 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. By Feb 20, 2020 in China, 75,465 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 2,236 patients deceased [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Based on our recent experts clinical experience on COVID-19, we found severe COVID-19 patients are difficult to rescue not only because respiratory failure but also susceptibility to heart failure. The coronavirus for COVID-19 is a new strain which was not previously identified. Whether the coronavirus for COVID-19 causes heart injury and thereby impacts mortality has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, in this retrospective cohort study, we fully assessed heart injury indicators on admission in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to explore whether heart injury already occurs in COVID-19 at early stage and hereby aggravates mortality later."

            "Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury."

        "Introduction": [
            "Viral infection is a common cause of heart injury such as myocarditis. It is well known that adenovirus, enterovirus and herpesvirus are the most common infectious etiologies for heart injury [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Since coronavirus-related carditis was first reported in 1980 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], increasing studies noted that coronavirus is an uncommon but unneglectable pathogen for heart injury. For instance, we found the coronavirus of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 in China had no obvious connections with heart injury. However, it was reported that the coronavirus of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 in Saudi Arabia could cause acute myocarditis and heart failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious viral pneumonia breaking out in Wuhan, China since Dec, 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. By Feb 20, 2020 in China, 75,465 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 2,236 patients deceased [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Based on our recent experts clinical experience on COVID-19, we found severe COVID-19 patients are difficult to rescue not only because respiratory failure but also susceptibility to heart failure. The coronavirus for COVID-19 is a new strain which was not previously identified. Whether the coronavirus for COVID-19 causes heart injury and thereby impacts mortality has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, in this retrospective cohort study, we fully assessed heart injury indicators on admission in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to explore whether heart injury already occurs in COVID-19 at early stage and hereby aggravates mortality later."

Patients with missing clinical information were excluded. Age of the enrolled patients ranged from 21 to 83 years old. Up to Feb 11, 2020, follow up in hospital was completed for all patients. One hundred and forty-five patients were cured and discharged while 43 patients deceased in hospital. This research was approved by the Review Board of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.

        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "In this study, we first assessed the associations between heart injury indicators and mortality in COVID-19 patients. hs-TNI is a biomarker released into blood once myocardial necrosis. Aberrant hs-TNI usually specifically indicates acute myocardial infarction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. In our study, we found hs-TNI increase tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidities (especially hypertension). Approximately 11.2% COVID-19 patients happened to acute myocardial infarction on admission (aberrant hs-TNI > 28 pg/mL), which was consistent to the previous reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. More importantly, we found high hs-TnI on admission (\u2265 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical upper normal limit (\u2264 28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. hs-TNI level was significantly negatively correlated with survival days. Therefore, we suggest the clinical upper normal limit of hs-TNI should be lowered for COVID-19, in order to avoid negligence of heart injury for COVID-19 patients on",
            "The admission. Our suggestion also agrees with the opinion, which was issued on Lancet in 2018 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], that reclassification of hs-TNI for acute coronary syndrome in emergency departments in order to improve clinical outcomes. CK-MB is another sensitive heart injury indicator which can also reflect myocarditis and myocardial infarction. After acute myocardial infarction, CK-MB will begin to increase at 2-4 hours, peak at 12 hours, and return to baseline within 48-72 hours [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In our study, we found CK-MB increase tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. Approximately 10.1% COVID-19 patients had CK-MB exceeding clinical upper normal limit (24 U/L) on admission. High CK-MB on admission (\u2265 18 U/L), even within the clinical upper normal limit (\u2264 24 U/L), already was associated higher mortality. These results proved heart injury such as viral myocarditis or myocardial infarction indeed occurred in COVID-19 on admission and predicted adverse clinical outcomes.",
            "LDH and \u03b1-HBDH are two kinds of myocardial enzymes. LDH and \u03b1-HBDH mainly exist in myocardia and would be released into blood once myocardial injury. Although LDH and \u03b1-HBDH increases are relatively less specific in heart injury, they also play important helping roles in recognition of myocarditis or myocardial infarction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. In our study, we found increases of LDH and \u03b1-HBDH were more likely to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and \u03b1-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. In addition, we found high LDH and \u03b1-HBDH were associated with more acute respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness, chest distress or pain, dyspnea or respiratory failure on admission. This result also implied that the increases of LDH and \u03b1-HBDH might not be specific due to heart injury. LDH and \u03b1-HBDH increases might not merely be induced by heart injury, but also be induced by lung or other organs injury. Nevertheless, LDH level on admission was significantly negatively correlated with survival days.",
            "The potential mechanism for COVID-19-caused heart injury might be virus-induced inflammatory storm. Inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammatory cytokines release can directly lead to apoptosis or necrosis of myocardial cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. In our study, we found high levels of heart injury indicators were associated with increased levels of inflammatory cells (WBC and neutrophils) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and CRP). Therefore, we speculated that COVID-19 infection would cause heart injury such as myocarditis or myocardial infarction by inducing inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammatory cytokines storm. Early and special anti-inflammatory treatments should be undertaken by cardiologists to protect myocardium [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Another potential mechanism for COVID-19-caused heart injury might be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\u2013mediated direct injury to heart. ACE2 as a human cell receptor had a strong binding affinity to the Spike protein of 2019-nCoV, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Recent study reported ACE2 is highly expressed in heart [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 of COVID-19 might directly attack heart by binding ACE2 on myocardial cells.",
            "Some limitations existed in this study. First, we only assessed heart injury from the perspective of serum myocardial enzymes and protein. It would be better if echocardiography and electrocardiograph were also measured in this study. Secondly, it would be better if we could assess heart injury-specific mortality in the future study with a larger sample size. Thirdly, we have not been able to obtain myocardial tissues from COVID-19 patients. Thus we currently cannot directly observe myocardial injury from the golden standard of pathology. Although the first autopsy of COVID-19 patient was completed and pulmonary pathology was obtained on Feb 16, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital (China), it remains a long way to remind clinicians to focus on cardiac pathology for COVID-19 infection. Our present results also can remind pathologists to pay attention to cardiac pathology in the future, especially for those deceased COVID-19 patients who had high heart injury indicators on admission."
        ],
        "Conclusions": [
            "In summary, heart injury signs arise in COVID-19 on admission and would be associated with subsequently higher and earlier mortality. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm or attack heart directly. Clinicians must beware of heart injury indicators for COVID-19 patients, especially for those with older age, hypertension and current smoking. In order to maximally prevent or rescue heart injury-related mortality in COVID-19, cardiologists must participate in early and special managements for patients with COVID-19.",

            "The authors found the coronavirus of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 in China had no obvious connections with heart injury.",
            "It was reported that the coronavirus of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 in Saudi Arabia could cause acute myocarditis and heart failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "Whether the coronavirus for COVID-19 causes heart injury and thereby impacts mortality has not been fully evaluated.",
