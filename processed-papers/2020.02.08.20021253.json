            "On December 29, 2019, Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in Central China, has reported four cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology. Since then, the outbreak has rapidly worsened over a short span of time and has received considerable global attention. On January 7, 2020, the pathogen of the current outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and its gene sequence was quickly submitted to WHO (The coronavirus was renamed COVID-19 by WHO on February 12).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] On January 30, WHO announced the listing of this novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) as a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d. As of February 11, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) of China had confirmed a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) associated with the COVID-19 in Mainland China, including 1114 fatalities and 4771 recoveries.<br/><br/>Since January 19, 2020, strict containment measures, including travel restrictions, contact tracing, entry or exit screening, non-hospital isolation, quarantine, awareness campaigns and others, have been implemented by the Wuhan Government and quickly adopted by other cities within China with the aim to minimize virus transmission via human-to-human contact. Similar measures were previously employed in China in 2009 to tackle the outbreak of H1N1 including mandatory quarantine of anyone who has had close contact with confirmed patients."

        "discussion": [
            "The dataset used in this study is based on the confirmed cases reported by NHC China. However, during the period of data collection, the official guidelines for diagnosis and treatment were updated four times. The criteria of confirmation have evolved from the original \u201cwhole genome sequencing of the respiratory excretion\u201d to \u201cpositive viral nucleic acid results by the RT-PCR of the respiratory excretion or viral gene sequence\u201d, and, most currently, the inclusion of positive nucleic acid results of the blood sample. In the meanwhile, the confirmation process is simplified by removing the accreditation process by the national expert committee for confirmed cases. The fourth edition granted the accrediting authority to the municipalities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] In addition, the medical resources in Hubei Province especially in Wuhan have been enhanced remarkably. All of these changes might result in a temporary surge of confirmed cases and lead to an overestimation of \u0734\u0bd6, especially in Hubei Province."

On January 7, 2020, the pathogen of the current outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and its gene sequence was quickly submitted to WHO (The coronavirus was renamed COVID-19 by WHO on February 12).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] On January 30, WHO announced the listing of this novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) as a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d. As of February 11, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) of China had confirmed a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) associated with the COVID-19 in Mainland China, including 1114 fatalities and 4771 recoveries.",
            "Since January 19, 2020, strict containment measures, including travel restrictions, contact tracing, entry or exit screening, non-hospital isolation, quarantine, awareness campaigns and others, have been implemented by the Wuhan Government and quickly adopted by other cities within China with the aim to minimize virus transmission via human-to-human contact. Similar measures were previously employed in China in 2009 to tackle the outbreak of H1N1 including mandatory quarantine of anyone who has had close contact with confirmed patients.",
            "This article investigates the change in the basic reproduction number \u0734\u0b34 and controlled reproduction number \u0734\u0bd6 since the outbreak of COVID-19. We have found that the estimated",
            "controlled reproduction numbers \u0734\u0bd6 in all different regions are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers \u0734\u0b34, but \u0734\u0bd6 is still greater than one in Hubei",
            "Province.",
            "Data were collected from provincial/municipal health commissions in China as well as through ministry of health in other countries and regions with details of each confirmed case including case ID, region, age, gender, date of symptom onset, date of diagnosis, history of traveling to or residing in Wuhan, and, if any, related remarks such as contact identification, cases and case-related information. In addition, the collected dataset also contains date of infection and chains of transmission of infection which can be inferred from travel or residency history in Wuhan and other relevant information, if available, as follows:",
            "(1) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but were exposed within a four-day period (i.e., the individual has had contact with a confirmed case of NCP on a certain day), then the corresponding date of infection is inferred as the middle of the exposure period;",
            "(2) If the individual has travelled to Hubei Province but has returned within four days, then the date of infection is inferred as the middle of the travelling period;",
            "(3) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but in close contact with an imported case from Hubei, then the individual is identified to be infected by this imported case;",
            "(4) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but in close contact with a local case who was clearly infected before that individual, then this individual is identified to be infected by the corresponding local case.",
            "Note: if the individual has been to Hubei Province, the transmission history would not be recorded despite the existence of contact tracing information."
        ],
        "3. Inference about the Serial Interval and Infectious Period": [
            "In this study, serial interval is defined as the time difference between dates of infection of successive cases in a chain of transmission (different textbooks may have different definitions). Infectious period is the duration of which an infected individual can transmit pathogens to a susceptible host. In this study, infectious period is defined as the time difference between date of infection and date of diagnosis as there is strong evidence showing that a diseased individual remains contagious even during the incubation period, and would be immediately isolated upon positive diagnosis hence losing the transmissibility. Both are key quantities that depict an epidemic and are essential to estimate the basic/controlled reproductive number, \u0734\u0b34 /\u0734\u0bd6 . Among 139 chains of transmission identified from 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as recorded by February 2, 2020, none of them have their dates of infection acquired, but 71 of them have their dates of symptoms onset available.",
            "Hence, the corresponding serial intervals were approximated by the differences in dates of symptom onset rather than the actual dates of infection, see Figure 1.",
            "We found that there were no significant demographical differences between the subset of cases used to estimate serial interval and infectious period and the cases in the full dataset. Therefore, the inference made on serial interval and infectious period based on the corresponding subsets should be able to represent the full dataset.",
            "The reproduction number \u0734\u0b34is defined as the (average) number of new infections generated by one infected individual during the entire infectious period in a fully susceptible population.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] It can be also understood as the average number of infections caused by a typical individual during the early stage of an outbreak when nearly all individuals in the population are susceptible. The basic reproduction number reflects the ability of an infection spreading under no control. When the size of susceptible population is limited, the quantity, effective reproduction number \u0734\u0bd8 , is used instead of \u0734\u0b34 . Similarly, the quantity, controlled reproduction number \u0734\u0bd6, should be used to describe the ability of disease spreading when interventions (such as quarantine, isolation, or traffic control) are taking place. Hence a good measure of any intervention is to reduce \u0734\u0bd6. Note that the disease will decline and eventually die out if \u0734\u0bd6 \u0d51 1."
        ],
        "5. Conclusion": [
            "Despite the continuous increase in new confirmed cases on a daily basis, the estimated controlled reproduction numbers \u0734\u0bd6 produced by all three methods in all different regions are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers \u0734\u0b34. As discussed in",
            "Section 4, the real-time controlled reproduction number may be even lower than the estimated values in Figure 3. Nonetheless, additional effort is needed to further reduce \u0734\u0bd6 below one in",
            "Hubei Province."
        ],
        "6. Discussion": [
            "The dataset used in this study is based on the confirmed cases reported by NHC China. However, during the period of data collection, the official guidelines for diagnosis and treatment were updated four times. The criteria of confirmation have evolved from the original \u201cwhole genome sequencing of the respiratory excretion\u201d to \u201cpositive viral nucleic acid results by the RT-PCR of the respiratory excretion or viral gene sequence\u201d, and, most currently, the inclusion of positive nucleic acid results of the blood sample. In the meanwhile, the confirmation process is simplified by removing the accreditation process by the national expert committee for confirmed cases. The fourth edition granted the accrediting authority to the municipalities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] In addition, the medical resources in Hubei Province especially in Wuhan have been enhanced remarkably. All of these changes might result in a temporary surge of confirmed cases and lead to an overestimation of \u0734\u0bd6, especially in Hubei Province.",
            "Furthermore, the current containment measures mainly aim to cut the transmission from human to human via droplets of respiratory. However, other transmission pathways, including fecal-oral transmission and aerosol transmission, could not yet be excluded based on current evidence. If other transmission mechanisms do exist, the \u0734\u0bd6 values would remain high in the future unless further measures would intersect these transmission pathways."
