        "abstract": "The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.",

            "An outbreak of serious pneumonia disease was reported in Wuhan, China on 30 December",
            "2019. The causative agent was soon identified as a novel coronavirus - 2019-nCoV1. Case numbers grew rapidly from 27 in December 2019 to 7,818 globally as of 30 January 20202, leading to the WHO to declare a public health emergency. Many of the early cases were linked to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city, Hubei province, from where the probable zoonotic source is speculated to originate3. Currently, only environmental samples taken from the market have been reported as positive for 2019-nCoV by the China CDC4. However, as similar wet markets were already implicated in the SARS outbreak of 2002-20035, it seems likely that wild animals are also involved in the emergence of 2019-nCoV. Indeed, a number of non-aquatic mammals were available for purchase in the Huanan seafood market prior to the outbreak4. Unfortunately, because the market was cleared soon after the outbreak began, determining the source virus in the wild animals from the market is challenging. Although a coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat in Yunnan in 2013 has now been identified6, closely related viruses have not yet been detected in other wildlife species. Here, we present the identification of 2019-nCoV related viruses in pangolins smuggled into southern China.",
            "We investigated the virome composition of pangolins (mammalian order Pholidota). These animals are of growing importance and interest because they are the most illegally trafficked of any group of mammal: they are used as both a food source and their scales are utilized in traditional Chinese medicine. A number of pangolin species now are regarded as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened",
            "Species. We received frozen tissue (lungs, intestine, blood) samples that were collected from",
            "Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) during August 2017-January 2018. These pangolins were obtained during the anti-smuggling operations by Guangxi Customs. Strikingly, highthroughput sequencing of their RNA revealed the presence of coronaviruses in six (two lung, two intestine, one lung-intestine mix, one blood) of 43 samples. With the sequence read data, and by filling gaps with amplicon sequencing, we were able to obtain six full or nearly full genome sequences - denoted GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L -",
            "that fall into the 2019-nCoV lineage (within the genus Betacoronavirus) in a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1a). These viruses also have similar genomic organization as 2019-nCoV, with nine predicted open reading frames (Figure 1b; Extended Data Table S5). We were also able to successfully isolate the virus using the Vero E6 cell line (Extended Data Figure S1).",
            "Based on these new genome sequences, we designed primers for qPCR detection to confirm that the raw samples were positive for the coronavirus. We conducted further qPCR testing on another batch of archived pangolin samples collected between May-July 2018. Among the samples (nine intestine tissues, ten lung tissues) tested from 12 animals, three lung tissue samples were coronavirus positive.",

Different assembly methods and manual curation were performed to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the full-length virus genome (denoted as GD/P1L in the Figure 1a tree).",

It has previously been noted that members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus have experienced widespread recombination8. In support of this, a recombination analysis performed here revealed that bat coronaviruses ZC45 and ZCS21 are likely recombinants, containing genome fragments from multiple SARS-CoV related lineages (genome regions 2, 5, 7) and 2019-nCoV related lineages including that from pangolins (regions 1, 3, 4, 6, 8).",

            "nCoV (Figure 2b). Hence, it is possible that the amino acid similarity between the RBD of the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV is due to selectively-mediated convergent evolution rather than recombination, although it is difficult to choose between these scenarios on current data. Although the drivers of any convergent evolution are unknown, its possible occurrence, as well as that of recombination, would further highlight the role played by intermediate animal hosts in human virus emergence.",

This suggests that these animals may be long-term reservoir hosts for these viruses, which is surprising as pangolins are solitary animals with relatively small population sizes, reflecting their endangered status10. However, it cannot be excluded that pangolins acquired their 2019-nCoV related viruses independently from bats or another animal host. It is also notable that both lineages of pangolin coronaviruses were obtained from trafficked Malayan pangolins, likely originating from",
            "Southeast Asia, and there is a marked lack of knowledge of the viral diversity maintained by this animal in regions where it is indigenous. Undoubtedly, the extent of virus transmission in pangolin populations requires additional investigation, but the repeated occurrence of infections with 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces suggests that this animal may be a potentially important host in coronavirus emergence.",
            "Coronaviruses, including those related to 2019-nCoV, are clearly present in many wild mammals in Asia5,6,7,11. Although the epidemiology, pathogenicity, interspecies infectivity and transmissibility of coronaviruses in pangolins remains to be studied, the data presented here strongly suggests that handling these animals requires considerable caution, and that their sale in wet markets should be strictly prohibited. Further surveillance on pangolins in the natural environment in China and Southeast Asia are clearly needed to understand their role in the emergence of 2019-nCoV and the risk of future zoonotic transmission."
