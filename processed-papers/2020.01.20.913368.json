Most patients had visited or worked in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. An exception being one woman who had not been to the market but has close contact with her husband, one of the patients who worked in the market before falling sick, suggesting the possibility that the agent can at least undergo a limited degree of human to human transmission. Apart from this couple, there is no strong evidence which suggests that the unknown agent is highly infectious as no health care personnel in the hospitals where the patients were admitted were infected.

According to the phylogenetic tree, human SARS viruses were closest to bat SARS-like viruses but with a lesser degree to bat coronaviruses, and was least related to other coronaviruses. The 2019-nCoV stands in a position between bat SARS-like viruses and bat coronaviruses, suggesting it is less related to the human SARS virus than other bat SARS-like viruses, and is likely a new type of bat coronavirus. Nevertheless, all coronaviruses that exhibit close linkage with 2019-nCoV originated from bat, strongly suggesting that this new coronavirus originated from bat (Fig 1a).",

As bats are not sold in the Wuhan market, animals that serve as the transmission vehicle remains to be identified (1, 2).",
            "The sequence of 2019-nCoV was annotated and aligned with several representative coronaviruses selected according to the degree of genetic relatedness depicted by the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1b). These included two highly homologous human SARS coronavirus: SARS CoV P2 (FJ882963) and SARS CoV ZJ02 (EU371559), one bat SARS virus that exhibits high homology with human SARS virus and similar potential to infect human as human SARS coronavirus: bat SARS CoV W1V1 (KF367457) (3), two bat SARS-like viruses that were not able to infect human: (bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Rp Shaanxi2011), and two un-related coronaviruses, the MERS virus MERS CoV (NC019843) and the Avian Infectious Bronchitis (IBV) virus IBV CoV (AY646283). The new 2019-nCoV was annotated slightly different from the human SARS virus and other coronaviruses, but the functionally important ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, and major structural proteins including the spike (S), membrane (M) and envelop (E)",
            "and nucleic capsid (N) proteins are well annotated (Fig 1b). Consistent with the phylogenetic tree data, 2019-nCoV did not align well with the MERS and IBV virus (Fig S1). Among the",

To check if 2019-nCoV is more close to bat SARS like virus or bat coronavirus, we selected two adjacent viruses from each group, bat SARSCoV Rf1/2004 and bat coronavirus BM48-31/BGR/2008, to perform alignment with the new virus with result showing that 2019-nCoV showed similar diversity from these two strains (Fig S1b). When 2019-nCoV was aligned with bat CoV HKU9-1, another bat coronavirus with further distance, it showed that",
            "2019-nCoV was very different from this virus (Fig S1c). These sequence alignment data were consistent with results of phylogenetic tree analysis and indicated that 2019-nCoV exhibited stands in between bat SARS like viruses and bat coronaviruses, but is genetically distant from the human SARS virus. It should be considered a new type of bat coronavirus.",
            "Since the S protein is the protein that exhibits the highest degree of genetic variations among different coronaviruses, we performed phylogenetic analysis of the S protein of different coronaviruses (Fig S2). Our data showed that the S protein of 2019-nCoV exhibited high homology with bat SARS-like coronaviruses such as bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, human SARS virus and bat coronaviruses. Homology of S protein of 2019-nCoV with representative human SARS virus, bat SARS like viruses and bat coronaviruses was determined as shown in Table S2. S protein of 2019-nCoV showed about 76% homology to human SARS virus P2 and high homology to bat SARS like viruses, while it showed 72% homology to closest bat coronavirus, bat coronavirus BM48-31, even lower homology with other bat coronaviruses.",
            "These data further suggested that 2019-nCoV is more likely a new type of bat coronavirus with only loose linkage with the SARS virus. Interestingly, different regions of the S proteins exhibited different levels of homology among the known coronaviruses (Fig 1b). Amino acid sequence alignment showed consistently that the N-terminal regions were far more diverse than the C-terminus, which seemed to be highly conservative (Fig S3a). Aligning these regions to the structure of S protein indicated that the structurally conserved C-terminal aligned well to the transmembrane domain which consists of a double helix, whereas the most variable region aligned to the N-terminal domain; on the other hand, the receptor binding domain exhibited intermediate level of sequence variation (Fig S3b).",
            "Due to the high amino acid sequence homology of the S protein in 2019-nCoV and the SARS virus which can cause severe human infection, we analyzed the structural similarity of this protein in various viruses. Protein structure modeling was performed to obtain high quality structure of S proteins from different coronaviruses (Table S1). The high level similarity observable between the structures of S protein from different viruses implied that the S protein of",
            "2019-nCoV and bat coronaviruses would most likely use the same human cell receptor as SARS virus. It was shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the cellular receptor of the SARS virus S protein (4). Complex structure of ACE2 with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein of SARS virus has been resolved and demonstrated tight interaction between these two proteins at the interaction interface (5). These data prompted us to determine the level of interaction between the S protein of 2019-nCoV with its potential cellular receptor ACE2.",

However, examination of interaction between RBD of 2019-nCoV and human ACE2 depicted only one potential hydrophobic interaction between ACE2(L79, M82) and RBD(F486) and one cation-\u03c0 interaction interaction ACE2(K353)/ RBD(Y492). Further examination of interactions between",

These data suggested that the higher binding affinity of RBD of coronavirus to ACE2 will confer the virus higher infectivity and pathogenicity.

Phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus of different species indicated that 2019-nCoV might have originated from bat, but the intermediate transmission vehicle is not known at this stage. Genetic linkage analysis showed that 2019-nCoV lied at the interface between bat SARS like coronavirus and bat coronavirus and should belong to a novel type of bat coronavirus owing to high degree of variation from the human SARS virus. Analysis of the potential interaction of",
            "RBD of 2019-nCoV with human ACE2 receptor protein indicated that its affinity to human cell is much lower than that of human SARS virus due to the loss of several important interaction sites, implying that the infectivity and pathogenicity of this new virus should be much lower than the human SARS virus. These data facilitate design of appropriate policies to control further dissemination of this new coronavirus.",
            "As of Jan 22, 2020, the infection cases were sharply increased in the past few days reaching a total of 440 cases with 9 confirmed death. Sporadic new cases were reported in more and more provinces in China. Human to human transmission has been confirmed as over 15 healthcare personnel have been confirmed to be infected. These epidemiological data were quite different from the data reported in the beginning and may suggest that the new virus could undergo human host adaption / evolution and become more adaptive to human host leading to more efficient human to human transmission. It is urgent to isolate and sequence the virus from the most recent cases to trace the evolutional mutations of the new virus. Using the analysis platform that we have developed above, we should be able to predict whether the new mutations could lead to the increase of infectivity of the mutated virus in a very short time."
