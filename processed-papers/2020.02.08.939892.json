        "abstract": "Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan of China and spread to several countries worldwide within just one month. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders.Our results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury. Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.",

            "In late December 2019, a cluster of mystery pneumonia cases emerged in Wuhan, a city in the middle south of China. Deep sequencing analysis and etiological investigations then confirmed the pathogen was a type of a newly identified coronavirus which had been labelled as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The rapid spread of 2019-nCoV caused the outbreak of pneumonia in China and also other countries, making it a severe threat to international public health security within a short period of time[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>Based on bioinformatics analyses, it has been shown that 2019-nCoV genome is 88% identical with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21), 79% with SARS-CoV, and 50% with MERSCoV4. Protein structural analyses revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain to that of SARS-CoV, directly binding to angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].<br/><br/>The most common symptoms of 2019-Cov infection are fever and cough in most patients, with symptoms of chest discomfort, progressive dyspnea or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported in a small number of patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. The laboratory findings of 99 patients infected with 2019-nCoV showed that 3 patients (3%) had different degrees of increased serum creatinine[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. In another clinical observation study, 4 (10%) of all 41 patients, including 2 of 13 (15%) ICU and 2of 28 (7%) non-ICU patients, showed the elevated serum creatinine[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. However, why and how the 2019-nCoV induced AKI remains largely unknown. In addition, whether 2019-nCoV can be transmitted through the urinary tract still remains a largely unanswered question. As ACE2 plays an important role in the 2019-nCoV infection, we aimed to identify the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in normal human kidneys and bladders by single-cell transcriptomes in order to explore the possible infection routes of 2019nCov and the roles of ACE2 in urinary tract system infection."

We reproduced the downstream analysis using the code provided by the author in the original paper. We obtained the scRNA-Seq data of healthy bladder tissues of three bladder cancer patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE108097). To be consistent with the kidney datasets, we applied Harmony[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] to integrate samples and performed downstream analysis using Seurat V3. Clustering analysis was done by first reducing the gene expression matrix to the first 20 principal components and then using resolution 0.3 for the graph-based clustering. We annotated the cell types afresh using the canonical markers listed in the supplementary table of the original paper. Kidney sample processing Kidney samples were obtained at a single site by wedge and needle biopsy of living donor kidneys after removal from the donor and before implantation in the recipient. Kidney biopsy samples were cleaned with sterile PBS after acquisition. Tissue dissociation The fresh kidney tissue was immediately transferred into the GEXSCOPE Tissue Preservation Solution (Singleron Biotechnologies) at 2-8\u00b0C. The samples were digested in 2ml GEXSCOPE Tissue Dissociation Solution (Singleron Biotechnologies) at 37\u00b0C for 15min in a 15ml centrifuge tube with continuous agitation after washed with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for three times and cut into approximately 1-2 mm pieces. Subsequently, cell debris and other impurities were filtered by a 40-micron sterile strainer (Corning). The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm and 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended into 1ml PBS (HyClone). To remove red blood cells, 2 mL GEXSCOPE Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (Singleron Biotechnologies) was added to the cell suspension and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and the cell pellet resuspended in PBS. Cells were counted with TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Library preparation and data analysis of scRNA-Seq The single cell suspension was proceeded to the single cell library preparation and sequencing, as previously described[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].

A wide range of nonrespiratory symptoms has subsequently been reported suggesting involvements of other organs during the course of the disease.

Importantly, SARS -CoV fragments had been detected by PCR in urine specimens of some patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV persistent infection and replication had been observed in the kidney, particularly in tubular epithelial cells in vitro24 ,indicating that the kidney damage in patients with SARS could be owing to the direct viral infection in target cells except for the consequences of the host immune response. However, the detailed mechanism of renal involvements of 2019-nCoV and SARS-nCoV is still unclear."

            "The analysis of ACE2 expression in the renal system The etiology of AKI in SARS seems to be multifactorial and still uncertain, which was thought to have a certain correlation with the high expression of ACE2 in the kidney[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Based on our single-cell analysis in both normal kidneys and bladders, we found both detectable levels of ACE2 in kidney and bladder. Kidney PT cells have higher expression percentages than bladder epithelial cells, which may indicate that kidney is more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection than bladder. Comparing to the expression levels of ACE2 in the digestion system 11 the lower expression of ACE2 in the renal and urinary system could suggest fewer patients with renal related symptoms, which positively correlates with the observations for SARS patients.",
            "Significance of the study Acute kidney injury, which has been proved to be a predictor of high mortality in SARS patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], may also lead to difficulty of treatment, worsening conditions and even be an negative prognostic indicator for survival for 2019-nCoV infection patients. Our study provided direct evidences for the possible infection of 2019-nCoV in the renal epithelial cells, which calls for more attention on the 2019-nCoV patients with acute kidney injury, especially during an extensive outbreak as the current status in the Hubei province. Finally, though there has been no reports of positive detection of 2019-nCoV in urine up till now, the distributions of ACE2 in the renal system and its detection in urine samples of SARS patients hinted the importance of virus-testing in urine samples of 2019-nCoV patients."
