From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed.\nResults A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4\u00b115.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15\u00b117.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217).\nConclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.",

The first order functions of time and R0 were obtained with the method of least square.

That is, the objective function is AT+B=R0, where A and B are the values of a and b that give the minimal value of S(a,b). The greater the absolute value of A (|A|), the faster the change of R0. We analyzed the relationship of population inflow from the epidemic focus and R0 at different time point for two cities respectively using Spearman correlation. The Mann Kendall trend test was used to evaluate the change of R0, average incubation period and average infectious period over the study period.

            "In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 starting from the identification of the first cases in two cities out of epidemic focus. We found that following the launch of Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, the spread rate of COVID-19 declined significantly in both of the cities. The relationship between R0 and population inflow from the epidemic center was observed to be different in Hefei and in Shenzhen. The consistent decline of R0 during our study period in both cities could be attributed to the consistent decline of average growth rate, as average incubation period and average infectious period were consistently increasing. We assume that such decline of growth rate could be attributed to the multiple strategies used in the Level 1 Response in the two cities, including public awareness of the risk, increased surveillance of suspected cases, immediate isolation of suspected cases, and restriction of gatherings, which have all been proven to be effective in controlling the spread of novel infectious diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. We found that there were different patterns in the epidemic of COVID-19 in the two cities. By comparing the data from local municipal CDC, we found that a major proportion of confirmed cases in Shenzhen during the study period were imported cases, while in Hefei has predominantly clustered cases, indicating that there were different patterns of disease spread in the two cities. This could be attributed to interaction of multiple factors, but population migration and social connections had played an important role[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. In Hefei, before Level 1 Response was activated, which included suspension of transportation in an out of Wuhan from 22 January, major inflow of population from Hubei/Wuhan was observed. The population inflow brought in imported cases. Therefore, during the initial stage of response, R0 were strongly correlated with population inflow from the epidemic focus. However, the inflow population people were largely Anhui natives, returning home for Chinese New Year. They tended to have extensive social connections in Hefei and would frequently attend gatherings with the local people. These gatherings accelerated the local spread and generated cases where patients had no travel history to the epidemic focus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. These local cases further spread the disease to the next generation of infection even after the travel ban to and from the city of Wuhan and adjacent areas.

            "Background and Objective To analyze the impact of different patterns of migration flow in two cities, Hefei and Shenzhen, on the epidemic and disease control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in order to provide insight for making differentiated controlling policies. Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4\u00b115.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15\u00b117.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health",
            "Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.",

This indicated that to control the spread of airborne and direct contact diseases such as COVID-19, we need differentiated strategies that pay special attention to population flow and cultural factors. For population migration, given our technological capability particularly in attaining and analyzing big data, we are able to monitor population in- and outflow by region and in real time. Under a novel infectious disease outbreak background, precautions should be taken to closely monitor the trend of population migration, and quick response should be made to deal with expected and unexpected population flow. For cities like Hefei, with predominant inflow of native population from the epidemic focus, restriction to gatherings would be a step of priority to contain infection considering both population migration and cultural factors. In the case of Shenzhen, close monitoring and quick response to unexpected large in or out flow of population would prepare the affected regions for adequate surveillance strategy and allocating healthcare resources for the incoming suspected and confirmed cases.",
