        "abstract": "Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. \nHere, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide estimation of the the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals and on the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), the infection rate. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged.\nBased on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ~4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ~3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ~2.6.\nOur forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 700,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February data and estimations of the actual numbers of infected and recovered in the population, the death toll might exceed 3,200 by February 29. However, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals),  but mainly because of the fact that if the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population are significantly higher (here of the order of twenty times) for the infected and ten times higher for the recovered than reported, thus resulting in a much lower case fatality ratio significantly below 1%.",

            "An outbreak of \u201cpneumonia of unknown etiology\u201d in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in early December 2019 has spiraled into an epidemic that is ravaging China and threatening to reach a pandemic state [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The causative agent soon proved to be a new betacoronavirus related to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV)<br/><br/>and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 disease has been named \u201cCOVID-19\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO) and on January 30, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to constitute a Public<br/><br/>Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO Director-General [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Despite the lockdown of Wuhan and the suspension of all public transport, flights and trains on<br/><br/>January 23, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases, including 6,484 (16.1%) with severe illness, and 909 deaths (2.2%) had been reported in China by the National Health<br/><br/>Commission up to February 10, 2020; meanwhile, 319 cases and one death were reported outside of China, in 24 countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].

For their computation, we used the first six days i.e. from the 11th up to the 16th of January to provide the very first estimations. We then proceeded with the calculations by adding one day in the rolling window as described in the methodology until the 10th of February. We also report the corresponding 90% confidence intervals instead of the more standard 95% because of the small size of the data. For each window, we also report the corresponding coefficients of determination (R2 ) representing the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, and the root mean square of error (RMSE). The estimation of R0 was based on the data until January 20, in order to satisfy as much as possible the hypothesis underlying its calculation by Eq(9)."

            "We have proposed a methodology for the estimation of the key epidemiological parameters as well as the modelling and forecasting of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China by considering publicly available data from the 11th of<br/><br/>January 2019 to the 10th of February 2020.<br/><br/>By the time of the acceptance of our paper, according to the official data released on the 29th of February, the cumulative number confirmed infected cases in Hubei was<br/><br/>\u223c67,000, that of recovered was \u223c31,300 and the death toll was \u223c2,800. These numbers are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of<br/><br/>February that are based on Scenario I. In Scenario II, by assuming a 20-fold scaling of the confirmed cases of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the confirmed number of the recovered cases in the total population, forecasts show a significant decline of outbreak in Hubei by 29th of February. This fact has been lately reported. Based on this scenario the casefatality rate in the total population is of the order of \u223c0.15%. At this point we should note that our SIRD modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact transmission network, the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, the characteristics of the population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already health problems). Also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19, which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people. The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial; these cases, which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 infections, remain unrecognized, especially during the influenza season [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. This highly likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context, distorting epidemiologic reality. Another important factor that should be taken into consideration pertains to the diagnostic criteria used to determine infection status and confirm cases. A positive PCR test was required to be considered a confirmed case by"

            "Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide estimation of the the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals and on the basis of a",
            "Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIR) model we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0 ), the infection rate. By calibrating the parameters of the SIR model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be \u223c4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be \u223c3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be \u223c2.6. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 700,000) by February 29.",

            "10th of February data and estimations of the actual numbers of infected and recovered in the population, the death toll might exceed 3,200 by February 29. However, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that if the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population are significantly higher (here of the order of twenty times) for the infected and ten times higher for the recovered than reported, thus resulting in a much lower case fatality ratio significantly below of \u223c1%."

            "February that are based on Scenario I. In Scenario II, by assuming a 20-fold scaling of the confirmed cases of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the confirmed number of the recovered cases in the total population, forecasts show a significant decline of outbreak in Hubei by 29th of February. This fact has been lately reported. Based on this scenario the casefatality rate in the total population is of the order of \u223c0.15%. At this point we should note that our SIRD modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact transmission network, the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, the characteristics of the population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already health problems). Also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19, which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people. The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial; these cases, which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 infections, remain unrecognized, especially during the influenza season [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. This highly likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context, distorting epidemiologic reality. Another important factor that should be taken into consideration pertains to the diagnostic criteria used to determine infection status and confirm cases. A positive PCR test was required to be considered a confirmed case by",
            "China\u2019s Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment program in the early phase of the outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. However, the sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel viral pathogen may only be 30-50%, thereby often resulting in false negatives, particularly early in the course of illness. To complicate matters further, the guidance changed in the recently-released fourth edition of the program on February 6 to allow for diagnosis based on clinical presentation, but only in Hubei province [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The swiftly growing epidemic seems to be overwhelming even for the highly efficient Chinese logistics that did manage to build two new hospitals in record time to treat infected patients. Supportive care with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in intensive care units (ICUs) is critical for severe respiratory disease. Large-scale capacities for such level of medical care in Hubei province, or elsewhere in the world for that matter, amidst this public health emergency may prove particularly challenging.",
