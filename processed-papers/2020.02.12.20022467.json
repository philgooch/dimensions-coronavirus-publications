Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.",

            "Our contribution. We examine variability in absolute humidity and transmission of COVID19 across provinces in China and other select locations. We show that the observed patterns of COVID-19 are not completely consistent with the hypothesis that high absolute humidity may limit the survival and transmission of this new virus.",
            "Epidemiological data. To conduct our analysis, we collected epidemiological data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and System website [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Incidence data were collected from various sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO); U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention the Chinese National Health Center (NHC) as well as DXY, a Chinese website that aggregates NHC and local CCDC situation reports in near real-time.

            "Estimation of a proxy for the reproductive number. Based on the cumulative incidence data for each province, we estimated a proxy for the reproductive number R in a collection of 5, 6 and 7-day intervals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. R is a measure of potential disease transmissibility defined as the average number of people a case infects before it recovers or dies. Our proxy for R, designated as Rproxy, is a constant that maps cases occurring from time (t) to time (t + d) onto cases reported from time (t + d) to time (t + 2d); where d is an approximation of the serial interval (i.e., the number of days between successive cases in a chain of disease transmission). For multiple time points, t, we obtained values of Rproxy(t, d) given by : C(t + 2d) \u2212 C(t + d)",
            "where the values of d range from [5 to 7], consistent with reported estimates of serial intervals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Our measure is considered only a proxy for R because it does not use details of the (so far poorly defined) serial interval distribution, but instead, simply calculates the multiplicative increase in the number of incident cases over approximately one serial interval. Such proxies are at least approximately monotonically related to the true reproductive number and cross 1 when the true reproductive number crosses 1 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. After computing these proxy values over a variety of subsequent moving time windows, a mean value was obtained and utilized as our estimated reproductive number R for each province. To minimize potential inclusion of imported cases in our analysis, R estimates were calculated after the closure of Wuhan on January 23rd, 2020.",
            "Weather data. We obtained monthly values of temperature and relative humidity data in January 2020 for each provincial capital in China from World Weather Online [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. We assumed that the majority of disease incidence for each province would occur or be reported in or near the capital due to increased population density in these metropolitan areas. We then calculated the \u201dabsolute humidity\u201d from these two variables for each province using the following formula, which is an approximation of the Clausius Clapeyron equation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]: 17.67T",
