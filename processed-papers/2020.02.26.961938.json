        "abstract": "An outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV. The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.",

            "In conclusion, two different deep learning-based models of protein structure prediction were used to show that the binding domain of 2019-nCov was highly conserved to the CTD1 region of the spike protein of SARS. In the functional prediction of protein, 28N or its molecules with similar structuresmay be used as a potential drug target to hydrolyze 2019-nCoV. Hopefully this study can help to develop new drug for the therapy of 2019-nCoV."

            "In this study, the nucleotide interval of the surface glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV was analyzed and it was similar to the spike interval of SARS-CoV8. Three-dimensional structure prediction of protein showed that the prediction model with the highest score in I-TASSER was comparable to the 5x58 spike protein electron microscope results, and the prediction model with the highest score in phyre[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] was comparable to the 5x5b SARS-CoV spike protein. Moreover, the prediction model in I-TASSER was highly similar to that in 5x58 which indirectly makes the nucleotide interval 2019-nCoV, indicating that the possibility of glycoprotein expression was increased again.<br/><br/>In addition, the 3D structure of CTD1 in the binding region of SARS-CoV and ACE2 was enlarged. In figure 4a and figure 4d, it was observed that there was a high degree of overlap between the S2 subunit of SARS-<br/><br/>CoV and the prediction model of 2019-nCoV, and the prediction model with conformation up and down was in line with the actual model of spike of SARS. Therefore, we speculated that 2019-nCoV and SARS may have the same ACE2 binding model. Previous studies built a preliminary 3D model of 2019-nCoV using the Swiss method, and the researchers found that compared with SARS, the 2019-nCOV changed four key bases, but its 3D conformation did not change significantly[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. In our 2019-nCoV 3D model, we found that 2019nCoV was highly similar to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) domain of SARS-CoV. The main chains of the two protein models were highly coincident and the conformation was in the same direction, and the possibility of combining 2019-nCoV with ACE2 was increased from another perspective."

The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV."

            "Iterative Threading Assembly Refinement (I-TASSER) is a layered method for protein structure and function prediction[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].It firstly identifies the structural template from the PDB through the local meta-threaded method (LOMETS), and then constructs the full-length atomic model through the fragment assembly simulation based on the iterative template. Next, the 3D model is re-woven into the thread through BioLiP, the protein function database, to yield a functional insight into the target. In the recent protein structure predictions for CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, CASP10, CASP11, CASP12 and CASP13, I-TASSER remains one of the best method for the automated protein structure prediction[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",

            "In addition, in the phylogenetic tree, the evolution of 33 virus samples was divided into three categories.Clade A is basically unchanged nucleotide sequence, Clade B is A sample with individual site variation (site<=3), and Clade C is A single sample (site=5).The distance scale of the tree is 0.0001.

            "In Supplementary Table 3, the top 10 known proteins in I-TASSER with the highest structural similarity to the prediction model with the highest score were listed (all structures in the PDB library were matched by tmalign). After analyzing the structures of these 10 known proteins, it was found that only the first two (PDB ID: 5x58 A and 6nzk A) were coronavirus proteins. Moreover, 5x58, which ranks the first, is the spike trimer of SARS, which is exactly consistent with our prediction that the nucleotide sequence was inferred to be spike. Reports on 5x58 indicated that spike was divided into four structural domains, among which C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) binds ACE2 as receptor binding domain (figure 4c)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. After combining 5x58 with ITASSER prediction model (figure 4d), there were similar up and down proteins. This indicated that the binding of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to human cells and the conformation of CTD1 may also change from downward to upward, making ACE2 binding to RBD unimpeded.",
            "In the functional prediction model of proteins, binding sites ranking from 1st to 5th were PDB ID7: 3srcA (C Sore=0.05), 1a5tA (C Sore= 0.03), 4dv3B (C Sore= 0.03), 4fmal (C Sore= 0.03), and 5hhja (C Sore= 0.02) (Supplementary Table 4), respectively. Further analysis of the binding site ranking the first showed that it was the binding site of Acyl-homoserine lactone acylase (PvdQ) which catalyzes the deacylation of acylhomoserine lactone (AHL or acyl-HSL), releasing homoserine lactone (HSL) and the corresponding fatty acid (figure 3), and the residues of binding site were Thr-874, Leu-877, and Leu-878 with binding affinity IC50=130 \u03bcM (from pdbbind-cn).",
            "In the receptor results, 3src was ranked the first (3src is the PDB ID of PvdQ,), and its predicted binding ligand was 28N (8-BROMO-4H-[1,2,4]OXADIAZOLO[3,4-C][1,4]BENZOXAZIN-1-ONE). We hypothesized that the molecules with similar structures like 28N might bind to the site Thr-874, Leu-877, and Leu-878 of the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV, thereby enabling viral hydrolysis and inhibiting viral reproduction."

        "Discussion": [
            "In this study, the nucleotide interval of the surface glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV was analyzed and it was similar to the spike interval of SARS-CoV8. Three-dimensional structure prediction of protein showed that the prediction model with the highest score in I-TASSER was comparable to the 5x58 spike protein electron microscope results, and the prediction model with the highest score in phyre[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] was comparable to the 5x5b SARS-CoV spike protein. Moreover, the prediction model in I-TASSER was highly similar to that in 5x58 which indirectly makes the nucleotide interval 2019-nCoV, indicating that the possibility of glycoprotein expression was increased again.",
            "In addition, the 3D structure of CTD1 in the binding region of SARS-CoV and ACE2 was enlarged. In figure 4a and figure 4d, it was observed that there was a high degree of overlap between the S2 subunit of SARS-",
            "CoV and the prediction model of 2019-nCoV, and the prediction model with conformation up and down was in line with the actual model of spike of SARS. Therefore, we speculated that 2019-nCoV and SARS may have the same ACE2 binding model. Previous studies built a preliminary 3D model of 2019-nCoV using the Swiss method, and the researchers found that compared with SARS, the 2019-nCOV changed four key bases, but its 3D conformation did not change significantly[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. In our 2019-nCoV 3D model, we found that 2019nCoV was highly similar to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) domain of SARS-CoV. The main chains of the two protein models were highly coincident and the conformation was in the same direction, and the possibility of combining 2019-nCoV with ACE2 was increased from another perspective.",
            "In previous reports, ACE2 was highly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], and in the eyes of the aqueous humor, cornea and conjunctiva[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. In the most recent cases, people with conjunctivitis and diarrhea were infected. Therefore, from this perspective, it can also be explained that the entry pathway of 2019-nCov in human may be binding to ACE2 receptor. If this inference is true, then healthy people should also be careful to treat patients' feces. and people who go to places with high virus density (such as fever clinic) must pay attention to eye protection measures to prevent the viral infection through the Aqueous humor.",
            "Here we suggest that 28N may be a potential drug target for 2019-nCoV. According to Coach analysis, we found that 28N could be an strong ligand to bing the S protein. In past studies, it was found that 28N can strongly bind PvdQ, and the residues near its binding site are T166, L169 and L17012. In the spatial structure simulation of S protein of 2019-ncov, we found that S protein has a three-dimensional structure highly cosimilar to PvdQ. More importantly, its binding site residues are also T874, L877 and L878, which are almost exactly matched. This conclusion indicates that 28N can bind to S protein. A search on the pubchem platform revealed that seven of the eight BioAssay Results listed as active were as inhibitors and one as stimulants. We speculate that 28N can inhibit the activity of S protein of 2019-ncov, but more experiments are needed to confirm this conclusion.",
            "Previous reports have suggested that the conformational transformation of CTD1 from bottom to top was a prerequisite for receptor binding[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and that the spike protein of 2019-nCoV should also be trimer. A switch with more than one \"up\" CTD1 conformation will result in cleavage of the S1-ACE2 complex. Therefore, the research on new pneumonia drugs can also start from how to make spike trimer to turn on the upward switch. Antibodies against ACE2 or any compound that can bind to ACE2 are expected to be used in 2019-nCoV therapy, and the recognition of receptor binding sites will also contribute to the development of 2019-nCoV vaccine.",
            "In conclusion, two different deep learning-based models of protein structure prediction were used to show that the binding domain of 2019-nCov was highly conserved to the CTD1 region of the spike protein of SARS. In the functional prediction of protein, 28N or its molecules with similar structuresmay be used as a potential drug target to hydrolyze 2019-nCoV. Hopefully this study can help to develop new drug for the therapy of 2019-nCoV."
