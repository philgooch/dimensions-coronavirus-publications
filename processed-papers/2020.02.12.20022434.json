        "abstract": "Background: \nSince the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, 2019-nCoV has rapidly spread across China as well as caused multiple introductions in 25 countries as of February, 2020. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of emerging disease. The present study aimed to estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics.\nMethods: \nWe employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For estimation, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed nCov cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were used.\nResults: \nWe found that our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11-8.18) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 has declined R to 3.24 (95%CrI: 3.16-3.32), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 983006 (95%CrI: 759475-1296258) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 9.8% (95%CrI: 7.6-13.0%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.07% (95% CrI: 0.05%-0.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17-0.30%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.06%\nConclusions: \nWe have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.",

These sustained high R values in Wuhan City even after the lockdown and mobility restrictions suggests that transmission is occurring inside the household or in healthcare settings [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], which is a landmark of past SARS and MERS outbreaks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].Considering the potent transmissibility of 2019-nCov in confined settings, as illustrated by the ongoing 2019-nCov outbreak aboard a cruise ship, the Diamond",

These findings indicate that the death risk in Wuhan is estimated to be much higher than those in other areas, which is likely explained by hospital-based transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Indeed, past nosocomial outbreaks have been reported to elevate the CFR associated with MERS and SARS outbreaks, where inpatients affected by underlying disease or seniors infected in the hospital setting have raised the CFR to values as high as 20% for a MERS outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",

High probability of occurrence in the above equation suggests that zero observed cases at some point is not due to the absence of those infected, but due to a low reporting rate. A very low reporting probability suggests that it is difficult to diagnose 2019\u2013nCov cases or a breakdown in medical care delivery.",

            "Our results are not free from the limitations. First, our methodology aims to capture the underlying transmission dynamics. By implementing mass screening in certain populations is a useful approach to ascertain the real proportion of those infected and a way of adding credibility to the estimated values. Second, it is worth noting that the data of Japanese evacuee employed in our analysis is not a random sample from the Wuhan catchment population. Indeed, it also plausible that their risk of infection in this sample is not as high as local residents in Wuhan, underestimating the reproduction number."
