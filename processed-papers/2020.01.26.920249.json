        "abstract": "BackgroundA novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.MethodsPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.ResultsOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5\u2019-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\u2019-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\u2019-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.ConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.",

            "Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5\u2019-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\u2019-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\u2019-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch."

            "The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.

(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)",
            "A similarity plot was performed using a sliding window of 450 nts moving in steps of 50 nts, between the query sequence (2019-nCoV) and different sequences grouped according to their clustering pattern. The similarity plot (figure 1A, B) suggested that the RaTG13 was the most closely related sequence to the 2019-nCoV throughout the genome. The genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 was 96.3% (p-uncorrected distance: 0.0369). On the other hand, a discordant relationship was detected between the query and the sequences of the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus (MG772934 and MG772933) (figure 1C). Specifically in in the 5\u2019-part of the genome spanning the first 10,901 nts of the alignment that correspond to the 11,498 nucleotides of the prototype strain (NC_045512) and the last 3\u2019-part spanning 22,831-27,933 positions (24,341-30,696 nucleotides in the NC_045512), 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences (figure 1C). In the middle region spanning the 3\u2019-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions (10,901-22,830 nts in the alignment or 11,499-24,340 of the NC_045512), 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch (figure 1B, 1C). In this region the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 is distantly related to the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Phylogenetic analyses using different methods confirmed these findings. A BLAST search of 2019-nCoV middle fragment revealed no considerable similarity with any of the previously characterized corona viruses (figure 2).",

The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. On the other hand, there is evidence for discordant phylogenetic relationships between 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 clade with their closest partners the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. In accordance with previous analysis (http://virological.org/t/ncovs-relationship-to-bat-coronaviruses-recombinationsignals-no-snakes/331), bat SARS-like coronavirus sequences cluster in different position in the tree, suggesting that they are recombinants, and thus that the 2019nCoV and RaTG13 are not [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. One previous study based on codon usage analyses suggested that the spike protein of 2019-nCoV might have originated from one yet-unknown unsampled coronavirus through recombination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Codon usage analyses can resolve the origin of proteins with deep ancestry with insufficient phylogenetic signal or invented de novo. The recently published bat coronavirus sequence however provides strong phylogenetic information to resolve the origin of the Spike protein as well as the rest of the genome suggesting a uniform ancestry across the genome. We have previously shown that phylogenetic discordance in deep relationships of coronaviruses is common and can be explained either by ancient recombination event or altered evolutionary rates in different lineages, or a combination of both [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Our study rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event. Notably, the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. This genomic part comprises also half of the spike region encoding a multifunctional protein responsible also for virus entry into host cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>].
