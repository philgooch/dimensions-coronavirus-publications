        "abstract": "Summary \n\nObjective To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized patients and to offer suggestions to the urgent needs of COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis and treatment. \n\n \n\nMethods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed.  \n\n \n\nFindings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. \n\n \n\nInterpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively. \n\n \n\nKey Words SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; epidemiological and clinical features; diagnosis",

Further understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 is of great importance for the early detection of patients and reduction of severe cases and deaths[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].<br/><br/>The present study was based on 102 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Xiangyang No.1 People\u2019s Hospital, Hubei. There was no significant sex difference among our cases with a men-to-women ratio of 1.04 (52:50), which is not in line with previous studies. Huang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and Chen et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] found a higher percentage of men with a men-to-women ratio of 2.71 (30:11) and 2.09 (67:32) in a total of 41 and 99 inpatients, respectively. Discrepancy may be attributed by the differences of the occupational feature between the first- and secondgeneration transmission cases. In Huang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] study, 27 out of 41 patients were directly exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan where was suspected to be the source of infection.

        "conclusion": [
            "Patients in Xiangyang were mostly secondary transmission cases with the family-clustering feature and unclear contact history. The rate of severe illness and death were low, whereas some patients had longer incubation period. We, therefore, recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks when necessary. All patients with positive real-time RTPCR results had significant clinical symptoms and radiological features, which suggests we could use a combination of real-time RT-PCR, chest CT scans and clinical manifestations on admission to increase the diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity of three rounds of real-time RTPCR together with two rounds of chest CT scans was higher compared with other diagnostic methods. Thus, \u201c3+2\u201d strategy should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively."

Nodular ground-glass opacities occurred with consolidation, with ambiguous borderline and blood vessels going through (Figure 1 B-C). In severe abnormalities, diffuse patchy or grid ground-glass opacities with heterogeneous density presented, partially with clear borderline, in which air bronchogram and vascular shadow can be seen.

            "Seven cases were imported from Wuhan and 37 had travel history to Wuhan, together accounting for 43% of 102 cases. The rest were secondary transmission cases, among which 23 were family clustering and 31 patients without clear contact history. Compared with previous studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], the main routes of transmission in our cases were different. The family is the fundamental unit of society in China. It is unlikely to avoid close contact without clear diagnosis of the disease, or even if the diagnosis is clear but the patient is not isolated. Based on the family-clustering feature of SARS-CoV-2 infected population in Xiangyang, it is of great significance to confirm suspected cases and quarantine them from their family as early as possible, especially in areas dominated by secondary transmission cases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",

The prolonged incubation period will increase the risk of virus transmission. According to Diagnosis Guidance for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia the 5th Edition[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], individuals with close contact history need to be quarantined for 14 days. The present study suggested that those potential patients were still likely to transmit the virus even after a 14-day quarantine. Real-time RT-RNA testing and medical observation before release should be strengthened and the quarantine time should be extended if necessary.",
            "Only two cases were under 18 years old (one case with 15 and 1.5 years old), which indicated that people with good health status and immunity were not susceptible. The majority of our patients were 50 to 70 years old with common chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, chronic bronchitis, etc. Those people have low immunity, organic damage, and decreased body regulation, which may explain the high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this age group[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. In addition, disease severity and fatality were higher among the elderly compared with the rest cases. The three deaths in this study were 72, 73 and 78 years old. Among three deaths, one was infected with SARS-CoV-2 after recent lung cancer surgery, one had diabetes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism, and one had hypertension and coronary heart disease[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. In the absence of cure, it is essential to protect the elderly population, and therefore, to reduce the incidence. Meanwhile, early intervention and control of basic diseases may be a way to reduce the critical ill rate and mortality of the aged-infected population.",

Among 102 patients, the major clinical characteristics were fever (84.3%), cough (56.9%), fatigue (27.5%), etc. Most cases had mild fever (body temperature 37.3 \u00b0C -38.5 \u00b0C) and irritant dry cough. A few patients (12.7%) have a small amount of white frothy sputum and runny nose (2%). In our patients, two cases had diarrhea as the main symptom and 13 cases had diarrhea during the course of the disease. The total incidence of diarrhea and loss of appetite was 15% and 10%, respectively, which differed from previous studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The disagreement may be caused by the nature of the systemic infection of the virus, the insufficient understanding of the disease.

            "The included individuals in this study were all patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results. All of them had different clinical manifestations and 98% had typical radiological findings indicating that real-time RT-PCR detection may be a diagnostic method with a low misdiagnosis rate. However, the positive rate of the first real-time RT-PCR test was only 66%. Thus, the rate of missed diagnosis is relatively high if only use single real-time RT-PCR test[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. The rate of right diagnosis is 88% for CT examination at the first time and all firsttime diagnosed patients had fever and cough. RNA detection combined with CT at the first diagnosis, along with clinical manifestations can greatly increase the sensitivity and reduce the rate of missed diagnosis. The cumulative positive rate of three times of throat swabs virus RNA tests was 96%, and the cumulative diagnostic coincidence rate of two times CT tests and nucleic acid tests reached 98%. The simultaneous application of two methods can basically detect all potential patients. Based on this, we inferred that \"3+2 \" combined strategy can diagnose most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which had great reference value for the diagnosis of \u201cclinically diagnosed cases\u201d. The application of the \"3+2\" diagnostic method was conducive to the effective control of the source of infection and was a key point to improve SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control.",
            "It has showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, using S-protein interacts with human ACE2, thereby infecting human respiratory epithelial cells, causing immune and inflammatory responses, and then producing cytokines and inflammatory mediators, such as IL1\u03b2, IFN\u03b3, IP10, MCP1, et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Moreover, studies have shown that the levels of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u0251 are significantly higher in patients with severe symptoms (ICU patients) than patients with mild symptoms, suggesting that the \"cytokine storm\" may be related to the severity of the disease[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Our study showed that the levels of C-reactive protein was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients (66 [68%] of 97 patients), and ESR was significantly accelerated (49 [57.6%] of 85 patients), indicating that there is a significant inflammatory response among COVID-19 patients. Blood routine results showed a decrease in lymphocytes count (56 [54.9%] of 102 patients), which means that the acute immune response consumes immune cells and suppresses cellular immune function, especially T lymphocyte function when the body encounters a new unknown virus invasion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Our studies also revealed that most patients had elevated ferritin levels (12 [92.3%] of 13 patients), and some patients had abnormal liver function and elevated muscle enzymes, which indicated the damage of lung, liver and other organ, and enhanced tissue repairment. Previous studies did not find an increase in ferritin among COVID-19 patients. The phenomena of elevating levels of ferritin may make it a new indicator of the severity of the disease's tissue damage and inflammation. However, whether C-reactive protein, ESR, serum ferritin elevation, and lymphocyte reduction and their abnormalities are related to the severity of the disease merits further study.",
            "COVID-19 patients in our hospital all received antiviral and symptomatic treatment, antiinflammatory treatment and oxygen therapy if necessary. Symptoms released markedly after one-week treatment on most patients. The rate of transferring to ICU and death was 8% and 3%, respectively, which was significantly lower than previous studies in Wuhan city. The improvement in clinical outcome revealed that an early prevention and timely treatment could effectively reduce the rate of critical illness and fatality proven in Xiangyang region with relatively sufficient medical resources.",
            "This study is a cross-sectional study, which only described and analyzed COVID-19 patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results. However, concerning the low sensitivity of throat swabs virus RNA detection in previous studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], we speculated that a part of suspected patients or undiagnosed patients might be COVID-19 positive cases. Thus, studies excluding those patients may not actually reflect the real picture of clinical and epidemiological feature of SARS-CoV-2 infected population. Also, accounting for the limited follow-up duration, our data may not reflect the complete course of COVID-19 development. In addition, it is a cross-sectional study with limited ability to infer the causal associations. In the current state of emergency, we hoped that our data-based findings could provide help for disease prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Patients in Xiangyang were mostly secondary transmission cases with the family-clustering feature and unclear contact history. The rate of severe illness and death were low, whereas some patients had longer incubation period. We, therefore, recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks when necessary. All patients with positive real-time RTPCR results had significant clinical symptoms and radiological features, which suggests we could use a combination of real-time RT-PCR, chest CT scans and clinical manifestations on admission to increase the diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity of three rounds of real-time RTPCR together with two rounds of chest CT scans was higher compared with other diagnostic methods. Thus, \u201c3+2\u201d strategy should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.",
