        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nDesign: Retrospective case studies\nSetting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China\nParticipants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020.\nMain outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities.\nResults: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P&lt;0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.\nConclusion: Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes.",

Circulatory and endocrine comorbidities were common among patients with COVID-19. Patients with at least one comorbidity, or more even so, were associated with poor clinical outcomes. These findings have provided further objective evidence, with a large sample size and extensive coverage of the geographic regions across China, to take into account baseline comorbid diseases in the comprehensive risk assessment of prognosis among patients with COVID-19 on hospital admission.<br/><br/>Overall, our findings have echoed the recently published studies in terms of the commonness of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Despite considerable variations in the proportion in individual studies due to the limited sample size and the region where patients were managed, circulatory diseases (including hypertension and coronary heart diseases) remained the most common category of comorbidity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Apart from circulatory diseases, endocrine diseases such as diabetes were also common in patients with COVID-19. Notwithstanding the commonness of circulatory and endocrine comorbidities, patients with COVID-19 rarely reported as having comorbid respiratory diseases (particularly COPD). The reasons underlying this observation have been scant, but could have arisen from the lack of awareness and the lack of spirometric testing in community settings that collectively contributed to the underdiagnosis of respiratory diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Consistent with recent reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], the percentage of patients with comorbid renal disease and malignancy was relatively low. Our findings have therefore added to the existing literature the spectrum of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 based on the larger sample sizes and representativeness of the whole patient population in China."

            "The main limitation of our study was the self-report of comorbidities on admission. Underreporting of comorbidities, which could have stemmed from the lack of awareness and/or the lack of diagnostic testing, might contribute to the underestimation of the true strength of association with the clinical prognosis. However, significant underreporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission. Moreover, the duration of follow-up was relatively short and some patients remained in the hospital as of the time of writing. More studies that explore the associations in a sufficiently long time frame are warranted. As with other observational studies, our findings did not provide direct inference about the causation or reverse causation of comorbidities and the poor clinical outcomes. Conclusions Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes. A thorough assessment of comorbidities may help establish risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 upon hospital admission."

Despite considerable variations in the proportion in individual studies due to the limited sample size and the region where patients were managed, circulatory diseases (including hypertension and coronary heart diseases) remained the most common category of comorbidity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Apart from circulatory diseases, endocrine diseases such as diabetes were also common in patients with COVID-19. Notwithstanding the commonness of circulatory and endocrine comorbidities, patients with COVID-19 rarely reported as having comorbid respiratory diseases (particularly COPD). The reasons underlying this observation have been scant, but could have arisen from the lack of awareness and the lack of spirometric testing in community settings that collectively contributed to the underdiagnosis of respiratory diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Consistent with recent reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], the percentage of patients with comorbid renal disease and malignancy was relatively low. Our findings have therefore added to the existing literature the spectrum of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 based on the larger sample sizes and representativeness of the whole patient population in China.",
            "A number of existing literature reports have documented the escalated risks of poorer clinical outcomes in patients with avian influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and MERS-CoV infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. The most common comorbidities associated with poorer prognosis included diabetes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], hypertension [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], respiratory diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], cardiac diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], pregnancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], renal diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] and malignancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Our findings suggested that, similar with other severe acute respiratory outbreaks, comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy predisposed to adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The strength of association between different comorbidities and the prognosis, however, was less consistent when compared with the literature reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. For instance, the risk between cardiac diseases and poor clinical outcomes of influenza, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections was inconclusive [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Except for diabetes, no other comorbidities were identified to be the predictors of poor clinical outcomes in patients with MERS-CoV infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Few studies, however, have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations. Kulscar et al showed that MERS-CoV infections resulted in prolonged airway inflammation, immune cell dysfunction and an altered expression profile of inflammatory mediators [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. A network-based analysis indicated that SARS-CoV infections led to immune dysregulation that could help explain the escalated risk of cardiac diseases, bone diseases and malignancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Therefore, immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation might be the key drivers of the poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 but await verification in more mechanistic studies.",
            "There has been a considerable overlap in the comorbidities which has been widely accepted. For instance, diabetes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] and COPD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] frequently co-exist with hypertension or coronary heart diseases. Therefore, patients with co-existing comorbidities are more likely to have poorer baseline well-being. Importantly, we have verified the significantly escalated risk of poor prognosis in patients with two or more comorbidities as compared with those who had no or only a single comorbidity. Our findings implied that both the category and number of comorbidities should be taken into account when predicting the prognosis in patients with COVID-19.",
            "Our findings suggested that patients with comorbidities had greater disease severity compared with those without. A greater number of comorbidities correlated with greater disease severity of COVID-19. The public health implication of our study was that proper triage of patients should be implemented in out-patient clinics or on hospital admission by carefully inquiring the medical history because this will help identify patients who would be more likely to develop serious adverse outcomes during the progression of COVID-19. A multidisciplinary team with specialists would be needed to manage the comorbid conditions in a timely fashion. Moreover, patients with COIVD-19",
            "who had comorbidities should be isolated immediately upon confirmation of the diagnosis, which would help provide with this susceptible population better personal medical protection.",
            "The main limitation of our study was the self-report of comorbidities on admission. Underreporting of comorbidities, which could have stemmed from the lack of awareness and/or the lack of diagnostic testing, might contribute to the underestimation of the true strength of association with the clinical prognosis. However, significant underreporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission. Moreover, the duration of follow-up was relatively short and some patients remained in the hospital as of the time of writing. More studies that explore the associations in a sufficiently long time frame are warranted. As with other observational studies, our findings did not provide direct inference about the causation or reverse causation of comorbidities and the poor clinical outcomes. Conclusions Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes. A thorough assessment of comorbidities may help establish risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 upon hospital admission."
