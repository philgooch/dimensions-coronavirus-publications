        "abstract": "Background: Since the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine.\n\nMethod: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study,  the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine.\n\nResults: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. \n\nConclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff  icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control.",

If we increase the factor by 0.01, the peak number of infections will decrease by 5.53%. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, if we incease the factor by 0.01, the peak number of infections will decrease by 14.64%. On the other hand, when \u07dd is close to 1, all the population is isolated from others, the peak value will decrease by 89.68%. However, when \u07dd tends to 0, all the population flows are control free, and the peak value will increase by 20.4%. As shown in Fig 3, the peak number of cases decrease as the traffic blockage factor increases.",

For the provinces except Hubei, the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26, if we incease the factor by 0.1, the peak number of infections will decrease by 4.01%. When the traffic blockage factor \u07ec is close to 1, the target area is almost completely in blockage, the peak value will decrease by 21.06% - 22.39% to the case that \u07ec tends to 0.",
            "Clearly, self-isolation and quarantine is more effective than traffic blockage.",

As shown in Fig 4, the quarantine factor \u07dd increase by 0.01, the peak arrival time in Hubei will arrive 0-2 days earlier, and the peak arrival time of other provinces outside Hubei will arrive 1-3 days earlier.

For the other provinces, if the quarantine is 1 week of delay, the peak value will increase by 20.92% - 22.77%, but 1 (or 2, resp.) week earlier will decrease by 32.78% - 35.60% (or 63.75% - 67.13%, resp.).",

As shown in Fig 5, when the traffic blockage factor \u07ec increase by 0.1 for Hubei, the peak arrival time will be earlier and the peak number of cases will be lower. If the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of cases only decreased by 3.10% - 3.79%, and two weeks by 6.64% - 8.08%. This illustrates that in the eve of city closure in Wuhan, the epidemic in Hubei province had been severe, and the transmission rate was quite high.

        "Since the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk",
        "In Fig 2, the current quarantine factor of Hubei province is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine",
        "For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, if we incease the factor by 0.01, the peak number of infections will decrease by 14.64%",
        "In this study, we have used a Flow-SEIR model to numerically estimate the efficacy of the quarantine and traffic blockage",
        "We introduced both the the quarantine factor and the traffic blockage factor, the flow variable and transmission rate in the model will vary as the change of these two intervation factors, the effectiveness of the traffic blockage and quarantine can be simulated and evaluated",
        "If the external population flows to the target area is almost completely blocked, the peak number will decrease by 21.06%-22.38%"
