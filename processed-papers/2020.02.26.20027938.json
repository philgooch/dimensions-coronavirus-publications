            "In conclusion, we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low in the general population, however, considering the common feature of the positive cases which are occupational exposure accompanied with conjunctivitis in the early stage, the higher viral aerosol load in the hospital and more opportunities to contact with COVID-19 patients, we highlight that ocular transmission is a potential important way of occupational exposure for medical staff. Therefore, To lower the risk of SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers, especially who work in the Fever Outpatient and Infection Wards. Patients with conjunctivitis in the epidemic area should also be treated seriously to rule out the COVID-19. Moreover, to date, the lower positive rate of conjunctival sac may be ascribed to the lower viral concentration, the sampling time lag, and the inefficient detection methods. Our study highlights the need for further research into the efficient detection methods of SARS-COV-2.

            "A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and CT abnormalities were identified with diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. The time for conjunctival sampling were had a mean [SD] day of 18.15 [7.57] days. Demographic data including patients\u2019 age, gender and the time for conjunctival sampling were shown in Fig. 1. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis were identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 was found in ocular discharges by RT-PCR only in one patient, the symptoms and laboratory test were shown in Fig. 2. Briefly, a 29-year-old nurse working in the Emergency Department at Tongji hospital, Wuhan City, China was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology at Tongji Hospital on February 1st, 2020 due to excessive tearing and redness in both eyes (Fig. 3A). No other systemic symptoms except for a moderate fever of 38.2\u00b0C was reported on January 31st, 2020. The ocular examination revealed conjunctival congestion and watery discharges in both eyes with normal best corrected visual acuity, normal corneal epithelium, quiescent anterior chamber and no tenderness or enlargement of the preauricular lymph node. We therefore excluded the possibility of conventional conjunctivitis, such as bacterial conjunctivitis, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, according to her clinical symptom and sign. She clarified medical N95 respirators continuously wore during operation, while occasionally worked with a dislocated eye mask touching her eyelids. Considering the occupational exposure by SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 related assay were arranged. Surprising, the chest CT showed multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Fig. 3D-F). The conjunctival and oropharyngeal swabs tested for SARS-COV-2 were both positive. The blood Rt showed a normal total white blood cells with elevated monocyte counts.

        "discussion": [
            "Like other highly contagious respiratory viruses, respiratory droplets are considered as the main route of SARS-COV-2 transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] However, other possible transmission ways should be taken into account owing to the rapid transmission. A recent bioinformatics analysis study analyzed 4 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, oesophagus, gastric, ileum and colon, and SARS-CoV-2 was found in stool samples of patients with abdominal symptoms.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Moreover, Lofy KH et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] detected the SARS-COV2 in a patient's stool, which warns us of the risk of fecal oral transmission. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 was also directly detected in the oesophageal erosion and bleeding site in a case with severe peptic ulcer symptom reported by Zhong et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Therefore, the real spread route is still a mystery, other transmitted ways should be further studied and confirmed. In the current study, we found that two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 was found in ocular discharges by RT-PCR only in one COVID-19 patient. Although the incidence of conjunctivitis is extremely low, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 have shown a capacity to use the eye as a portal of entry and cause ocular disease. To our knowledge, several anatomical and mucosal immune properties permitted the eye as both a potential site of virus infected site as well as a gateway for respiratory infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] In coincidence with our result, SARSCoV was detected by RT-PCR in tear samples from three probable cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Resemble as SARS-CoV, entry of SARS-CoV-2 via the host functional receptor is mediated by ACE2.15 Moreover, Sun and colleagues[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] found that ACE2 expressed in human cornea and conjunctival tissues, which providing strong evidence for our diagnosis. Furthermore, Dr. Guangfa Wang, a member of the national expert panel on pneumonia, reported that he was infected by SARS-COV-2 during the inspection in Wuhan, through unprotected eye exposure.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] Similarly, an anesthesiologist with insufficient eye protection confirmed with COVID-19 and also presented conjunctivitis as the initial symptom. The laboratory test revealed that the nasopharyngeal swab was positive while the conjunctival swab was negative.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] On the contrary, our case initially presented similar conjunctivitis with a positive conjunctival PCR result. Considering the same occupational exposure of Dr. Wang, the anesthesiologist and the nurse with positive conjunctival PCR result in our case, and the SARS-COV-2 infected mechanism, we believe that ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 must be seriously considered, especially in health care workers. The negative results of conjunctival sac in other 71 patients, may be owing to the lower viral concentration, the sampling time lag, and the lower positive rate of the inefficient diagnostic method. Ziad and colleague[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] found that tracheal aspirates yielded significantly higher SARS-CoV loads, compared with the nasopharyngeal swab and sputum specimens. This suggests that the viral concentration and genome fraction is diverse in different sites. In consideration of the ocular surface is an open microenvironment, and the viral may transport to the inferior meatus of the nose rapidly,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in ocular surface is likely to be very low. We also found that suspected patients often had 2~3 repeated tests of nasopharyngeal swabs before the positive result confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sampling time lag and the inefficient diagnostic method may contribute to this lower positive rate of SARS-CoV-2. de Wit and colleagues[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] demonstrated that, in the rhesus macaque model, MERS-CoV RNA could detect in the conjunctiva, and the viral loads could no longer be detected in the conjunctiva 6 days post infection. However, the mean time for conjunctival sampling are 18.15 days in our present study. Another thing needs to be considered is that the lower positive rate of RT-PCR makes early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 a challenge. Therefore, improvements in the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods need to be taking in the future. There are several limitations need to be considered. First, the conjunctival scraping test should be done as early as possible if we find ocular symptoms in a suspected one. The mean time for conjunctival sampling in our study are 18.15 days, in which exceeded the optimal detection time. Second, how to increase the positive rate. The most commonly used chest CT examination has certain limitations for the special suspected groups, such as pregnant women. In addition, we found that 2~3 repeated tests did in suspected patients of nasopharyngeal swabs before the SARS-CoV-2 was obtained, which may be related to the false-negative result of RT-PCR. Therefore, the low viral load in the ocular surface and the lower positive rate of RT-PCR makes early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 a challenge. Recently, Doan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] reported that the influenza virus and rubella virus found in patients\u2019 conjunctival sac or tears by the next generation sequencing rapidly, which provides us with a feasible direction for future study."

Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. The time for conjunctival sampling were had a mean [SD] day of 18.15 [7.57] days. Demographic data including patients\u2019 age, gender and the time for conjunctival sampling were shown in Fig. 1. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis were identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 was found in ocular discharges by RT-PCR only in one patient, the symptoms and laboratory test were shown in Fig. 2. Briefly, a 29-year-old nurse working in the Emergency Department at Tongji hospital, Wuhan City, China was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology at Tongji Hospital on February 1st, 2020 due to excessive tearing and redness in both eyes (Fig. 3A). No other systemic symptoms except for a moderate fever of 38.2\u00b0C was reported on January 31st, 2020. The ocular examination revealed conjunctival congestion and watery discharges in both eyes with normal best corrected visual acuity, normal corneal epithelium, quiescent anterior chamber and no tenderness or enlargement of the preauricular lymph node. We therefore excluded the possibility of conventional conjunctivitis, such as bacterial conjunctivitis, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, according to her clinical symptom and sign. She clarified medical N95 respirators continuously wore during operation, while occasionally worked with a dislocated eye mask touching her eyelids. Considering the occupational exposure by SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 related assay were arranged. Surprising, the chest CT showed multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Fig. 3D-F). The conjunctival and oropharyngeal swabs tested for SARS-COV-2 were both positive. The blood Rt showed a normal total white blood cells with elevated monocyte counts. On the basis of her epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, chest images, and laboratory findings, this patient was diagnosed with SARS-COV-2 infected acute viral conjunctivitis and pneumonia.
