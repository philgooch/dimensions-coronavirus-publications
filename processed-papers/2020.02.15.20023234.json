Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain.\nMethods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and perform a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine.\nResults: Under the home-quarantine program, the total number of the infected individuals would reach 24-53 from March 17-March 20, 50-86 from March 18-March 16, and 234-343 from March 4-March 23 with the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of pre-infectious individuals, in Seoul, South Korea, respectively. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. \nConclusion: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine are warranted along with other containment policies.",

The first individual with COVID-19 infection in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020 and, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases increased between then and February 12, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. To reduce the number of individuals entering South<br/><br/>Korea who may have been exposed to COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, an international travel ban from Hubei Province, China to South Korea was implemented on February 3, 2020<br/><br/>(Figure 1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Furthermore, to identify individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-<br/><br/>19, the South Korean public health authority implemented a quarantine program. Any persons who have travelled from a country with COVID-19 infection risk within the previous 14 days or have been in contact with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection within the previous days is defined as an individual for quarantine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Quarantined individuals are asked to comply with home-quarantine and are monitored by local public health workers twice a day for 14 days after contact with individuals with infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]."

We also assumed that the international students would arrive in Seoul, South Korea in the 15 days before and after March 1, 2020, and that no individuals were isolated during entry screening upon arrival. Furthermore, we assumed that all quarantined individuals were confined at home or to the university dormitory as per the current South Korean quarantine program for COVID-19 infection implemented by the local public health authority. The baseline scenarios were based on the currently identified number of infected persons from China in South Korea, which was 12 on February 6, 2020, with the assumption of 90% compliance with home-quarantine during the pre-infectious period. Scenarios with different quarantine compliance rates (70%, 80%, or 90%) among these international students were also modeled.

            "When no effective vaccine or treatment is available for infectious disease, the quarantine of individuals suspected of having the infection, including those exposed to infection from epidemic countries, has been used as a mitigation strategy by public health authorities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].<br/><br/>The number of laboratory-confirmed individuals with COVID-19 infection is increasing in China and other Asian countries. In South Korea, the likelihood of local transmission is increasing because travelers are arriving from COVID-19-affected countries.<br/><br/>The quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 is an efficient public health strategy, to reducing transmission while using limited public health resources, because the presence of individuals with unidentified infection is highly likely among individuals exposed to the infectious diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Therefore, the number of individuals with infection can be estimated based on compliance with home-quarantine to provide relevant evidence for public health authorities and to improve international students\u2019 compliance with the quarantine program in advance.<br/><br/>In South Korea, individuals who had contacted a person with infection were asked to comply with home-quarantine and were monitored by local public health workers twice a day for 14 days post-contact [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Individuals who were not included in the quarantine program but had experienced any possible contact were encouraged to notify public health authorities and submit to quarantine. All daily necessities were provided to all quarantined individuals by the public health authorities to avoid possible contact with any susceptible population, as indicated by the South Korean law. Therefore, the current quarantine program in South Korea is very broad and includes a large number of people. However, to relieve the pressure on public health resources, the quarantine program for incoming international students will be monitored by the education authority [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. This may affect the efficacy of quarantine and increase the number of infected and isolated individuals."

            "As public health resources are limited, quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to infectious disease is crucial for preventing local transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Therefore, strict homequarantine of individuals from countries at risk for COVID-19 infection is important to reduce the number of infected individuals and to prevent possible epidemics in the community.

We also assumed that the international students would arrive in Seoul, South Korea in the 15 days before and after March 1, 2020, and that no individuals were isolated during entry screening upon arrival. Furthermore, we assumed that all quarantined individuals were confined at home or to the university dormitory as per the current South Korean quarantine program for COVID-19 infection implemented by the local public health authority. The baseline scenarios were based on the currently identified number of infected persons from China in South Korea, which was 12 on February 6, 2020, with the assumption of 90% compliance with home-quarantine during the pre-infectious period. Scenarios with different quarantine compliance rates (70%, 80%, or 90%) among these international students were also modeled.

        ],
        "DISCUSSION": [
            "When no effective vaccine or treatment is available for infectious disease, the quarantine of individuals suspected of having the infection, including those exposed to infection from epidemic countries, has been used as a mitigation strategy by public health authorities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "The number of laboratory-confirmed individuals with COVID-19 infection is increasing in China and other Asian countries. In South Korea, the likelihood of local transmission is increasing because travelers are arriving from COVID-19-affected countries.",
            "The quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 is an efficient public health strategy, to reducing transmission while using limited public health resources, because the presence of individuals with unidentified infection is highly likely among individuals exposed to the infectious diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Therefore, the number of individuals with infection can be estimated based on compliance with home-quarantine to provide relevant evidence for public health authorities and to improve international students\u2019 compliance with the quarantine program in advance.",
            "In South Korea, individuals who had contacted a person with infection were asked to comply with home-quarantine and were monitored by local public health workers twice a day for 14 days post-contact [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Individuals who were not included in the quarantine program but had experienced any possible contact were encouraged to notify public health authorities and submit to quarantine. All daily necessities were provided to all quarantined individuals by the public health authorities to avoid possible contact with any susceptible population, as indicated by the South Korean law. Therefore, the current quarantine program in South Korea is very broad and includes a large number of people. However, to relieve the pressure on public health resources, the quarantine program for incoming international students will be monitored by the education authority [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. This may affect the efficacy of quarantine and increase the number of infected and isolated individuals.",
            "Our findings indicate that most of the infected individuals isolated from the homequarantine program; Therefore, epidemics by incoming international students are unlikely to occur in Seoul, South Korea; However, the number of infected and isolated individuals could increase by mid or late March. Furthermore, the quarantine program may consume a large number of public health resources because it involves monitoring quarantined individuals and isolating infected individuals.",
            "The present study had several limitations. Firstly, some parameters including the latent period and rate of infection among those in contact with a person with infection were obtained from the modelling studies of COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], and consequently may revise the results.

Thirdly, we did not consider transmission that occurred before symptom onset and did not account for subclinical infection."

        "CONCLUSIONS": [
            "As public health resources are limited, quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to infectious disease is crucial for preventing local transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Therefore, strict homequarantine of individuals from countries at risk for COVID-19 infection is important to reduce the number of infected individuals and to prevent possible epidemics in the community."
