Dimensions, from Digital Science, are maintaing a spreadsheet of all COVID-19 related papers, datasets and clinical trials:

This repository contains the JSON output from processing each DOI in this spreadsheet through the [Scholarcy API](https://sandbox-api.scholarcy.com/api/). Each DOI resolves either in a PDF (if open access), an abstract, a paywalled log-in page or a cookie notice! I have no way to determine which will be the case in advance, so the data is presented in its raw form. 

The JSON data structure is described in the table below:
